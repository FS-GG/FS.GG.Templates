# Scaffold map — durable vs replaceable (read before you design)

This generated product ships a **scaffold game model** plus a **durable governance
spine**. When you replace the scaffold with your own UI, you rewrite only the
replaceable parts; the durable parts keep compiling and keep their source/evidence
scans green across the swap. Read this map **before** you start designing, so you
know what survives and what you own.

> **Project-named paths.** A generated tree puts the product under
> `src/<ProjectName>/**` (e.g. `src/Invoice1/**`, `src/Spread1/**`), not a literal
> `src/Product/**`. Below, `<ProductDir>` means that directory — `src/<ProjectName>`
> — so every cited path matches your generated tree verbatim. The module name stays
> `Product.*` even though the directory is project-named.

## Replaceable `<ProductDir>/**` (rewrite when you swap the scaffold model)

These call/define the scaffold game model directly — they are yours to replace:

- `<ProductDir>/Model.fs` — the scaffold `Model`/`Msg`/`update` (the game state machine).
- `<ProductDir>/View.fs` — the scaffold `view` (`Model -> SceneNode`).

## Durable — model-agnostic (keep, do not touch)

These are pure plumbing with **no scaffold model references**; they keep compiling
unchanged across a model swap — do not rewrite them:

- `<ProductDir>/Program.fs` — host/CLI entry point (`Viewer.runApp`, the
  `--scene-evidence` / evidence command wiring). Host wiring only.
- `tests/Product.Tests/GovernanceTests.fs` — reads the product **source text** and
  asserts structural / evidence / discoverability invariants; never calls the
  product's `view`/`update`, so it **survives a scaffold-model swap**.

## Adding new source files is fine (keep the six scanned files' relative order)

You may add your own source files (e.g. a pure engine module) without breaking the
governance gate. `GovernanceTests.fs` asserts only the **relative compile order** and
presence of the six scanned scaffold files —
`Model.fs → View.fs → LayoutEvidence.fs → WindowOptions.fs → EvidenceCommands.fs → Program.fs`.
A new file inserted **before, between, or after** them is safe as long as those six keep
that relative order in the `.fsproj`. (You do not need to read the governance test body to
confirm this.)

## Durable — must re-point (keep the file + its scanned tokens, re-point model fields)

These are **durable** — keep the file and every must-survive source-scan token it
carries — **but** they read scaffold *model fields*, so on a model swap you must
**re-point those model-field references** at your own model. "Durable" here means
*keep the file and its scanned evidence tokens while re-pointing the model-field references* —
it does **not** mean "do not touch":

- `<ProductDir>/LayoutEvidence.fs` — layout-region bounds evidence; reads the
  scaffold's HUD/gameplay regions. Re-point the region computations at your own
  layout, keeping the evidence tokens.
- `<ProductDir>/EvidenceCommands.fs` — the deterministic `SceneEvidence.render`
  evidence command (`RendererMode = "deterministic-scene"`); renders the scaffold
  scene. Re-point it at your own `view`, keeping the command surface and tokens.
- `<ProductDir>/WindowOptions.fs` — window-options parsing/diagnostics; mostly
  model-agnostic but re-confirm any product-specific defaults after the swap.

## The test split: `GovernanceTests.fs` durable, `BehaviorTests.fs` replaceable

`tests/Product.Tests/` compiles `GovernanceTests.fs` **first** and
`BehaviorTests.fs` **after** (see `Product.Tests.fsproj`):

- **`GovernanceTests.fs` — durable, model-agnostic.** See above — do not rewrite it.
- **`BehaviorTests.fs` — replaceable scaffold-behavior.** Calls the scaffold
  product's `view`/`update`/host/scene-text directly. When you replace the
  scaffold model with your own, you **rewrite this file**; `GovernanceTests.fs`
  keeps passing.

## Worked example: remap the layout regions onto a non-game UI

`LayoutEvidence.fs` describes the scaffold as a **HUD** region and a **gameplay**
region. For a non-game UI you keep the file and its evidence tokens and re-point the
two regions onto your own surface:

- **HUD region → headers / toolbar.** The scaffold's status HUD becomes your app's
  header bar, toolbar, or command strip — the persistent chrome around the content.
- **Gameplay region → main content grid.** The scaffold's gameplay field becomes
  your main content area — e.g. the invoice line-item table or the spreadsheet
  cell grid — the scrollable region the user actually edits.

So an invoice builder maps HUD→the invoice header/toolbar and gameplay→the
line-item grid; a spreadsheet editor maps HUD→the formula/menu bar and
gameplay→the cell grid. Keep the region names' **evidence tokens** intact; only the
bounds computations re-point.

## Must-survive source-scan strings (keep these tokens present)

`GovernanceTests.fs` (and the framework's generated-guidance scans) assert these
strings remain in the product source across any model swap — keep them present
when you re-point the durable files:

- `--scene-evidence` and `SceneEvidence.render` (the deterministic scene evidence
  command) with `RendererMode = "deterministic-scene"`.
- The visual-evidence honesty vocabulary (decodable image; image dimensions;
  non-trivial content; renderer mode; fallback classification; unsupported reason;
  "metadata-only reports do not satisfy visual proof"; "1x1 fallback images do not
  satisfy visual proof"; benign/blocking/deferred warning; name-collision
  guidance) carried in `GovernanceTests.visualEvidenceGuidance`.

## API surface authority: the shipped `.fsi` / `docs/api-surface/` is ground truth

When you need to know a framework API's real shape, the **authoritative** reference
is the shipped `.fsi` signature files and the generated `docs/api-surface/` tree —
they are the curated public contract the packages actually expose. An
**agent-generated API summary** (e.g. an Explore/grep digest, or a hand-written
"here's what the API looks like" note) is **supporting reference only, never ground
truth**: it can silently mix confirmed signatures with inferred or stale shapes.
Always reconcile any agent-produced API summary against the `.fsi` / `docs/api-surface/`
before you design against it; when they disagree, the `.fsi` wins.

> `InteractiveAppHost<'model,'msg>` record (incl. the feature-108 additive `MapKeyChord` /

## Resolution-independent rendering: windowed-fullscreen blur (feature 085, FR-010)

The default window startup is **windowed fullscreen**, which scales a fixed-resolution scene
up to the monitor work area and **blurs** it. Two fixes: render with a **size-aware view**
(`InteractiveAppHost.View: Size -> 'model -> Control<'msg>`, content laid out to the actual
swapchain extent — the preferred path), **or** launch with exactly one flag —
`--window-startup normal` — for a 1:1 sharp normal window. See the `fs-gg-viewer-host` skill.

## Pre-design pointer: record-label collision (fs-gg-scene)

**Before** you design your model's records, read the `fs-gg-scene` skill's
**Common pitfalls → record-label collision** note. Scene point/rect literals use
the labels `X`/`Y`/`Width`/`Height`; if your own model declares a record with the
same labels, a bare literal can infer to the wrong record type. Plan your record
label names (or annotate/qualify) up front — it is far cheaper than reworking the
model after the inference errors appear.
