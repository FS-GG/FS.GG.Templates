description: Map a unit roster to legible vector symbols in a generated FS.GG.UI product, render boards headlessly, and run the render->eyeball->tweak design loop.
---

# Symbology Capability

## Scope

Use this skill for product code that turns per-unit stats into legible abstract vector symbols: build
a per-game `'stats -> Token` mapping, compose `gallery` / `filmstrip` boards, and rasterise them
headlessly to critique at the target on-board size. The grammar is fixed; the mapping is yours to edit.

## Public Contract

The signatures you consume are bundled with this product under `docs/api-surface/Symbology/` (the pure
`Symbology.fsi`) and `docs/api-surface/Symbology.Render/` (the `Render.fsi` bridge). The pure library
references only `Scene`; all raster/IO is in the render bridge. Build from `Symbology.defaultToken` and
override only the fields your game encodes.

## Usage

```fsharp
open FS.GG.UI.Scene
open FS.GG.UI.Symbology
open FS.GG.UI.Symbology.Render

type UnitStats = { Side: string; Role: string; Dps: float; Hp: float; HpMax: float; Facing: float }

// the editable per-game mapping (data — NOT library internals):
let mapUnit (u: UnitStats) : Token =
    { Symbology.defaultToken with
        R = 28.0
        Faction = (match u.Side with "blue" -> Ally | "red" -> Enemy | _ -> Neutral)
        Klass = (match u.Role with "tank" -> Heavy | "scout" -> Scout | _ -> Mobile)
        Threat = min 1.0 (u.Dps / 120.0)
        Health = u.Hp / u.HpMax
        Heading = u.Facing }

let board = Symbology.gallery 4 90.0 (roster |> List.map mapUnit)
let png   = Render.toPng { Width = 920; Height = 660 } board "./readiness/symbology/iter-001"
// -> read `png` back, critique at the target size, TWEAK mapUnit ONLY, repeat.
```

## Identity label (opt-in inspection-detail channel)

`Token` carries an optional `Label : LabelText option` — a short callsign/code drawn screen-aligned in a
per-grammar region. Set it in `mapUnit` only when the abstract sigil cannot disambiguate identity:

```fsharp
{ Symbology.defaultToken with R = 28.0; Faction = Ally; Label = Some (Symbology.plainLabel u.Callsign) }
```

- **Inspection-detail, not pop-out.** It complements — never replaces — the vector `Sigil`; keep strings
  short. It is **not** in the legibility capacity table, so the linter's verdict is unchanged by labels.
- **Opt-in, zero-drift.** `Label = None` (the default) and empty/whitespace render byte-identically to the
  pre-feature symbol; the one mapping still drives all three grammars unchanged.
- **Tofu-free is a render-edge property.** The pure library emits a deterministic glyph-run node and never
  requires a measurer; legible non-tofu glyphs come from the render bridge. Overlong labels are fitted
  (shrink, then ellipsis-truncate); a degenerate (`R <= 0`) labelled token still degrades to the placeholder.
- **Multi-line rides the same field.** `Label` may carry more than one line: embedded `\n` are hard breaks,
  and a long line soft-wraps at whitespace to the region width — no new field, no second channel. Keep to a
  few short lines (budget **Token ≤ 3, Badge ≤ 2, Ring ≤ 2**); lines stack downward from the spec-196
  baseline, screen-aligned. Surplus degrades **wrap → cap → ellipsis** (the last drawn line ends with `…`);
  empty/whitespace/blank-lines collapse to no label. A one-line-fitting label stays byte-identical, so `\n`
  is the only way to force a break; every line is tofu-free only through the render bridge's real measurer.

```fsharp
// A callsign over a code — two lines in the one field:
{ Symbology.defaultToken with R = 28.0; Faction = Ally; Label = Some (Symbology.plainLabel (u.Callsign + "\n" + u.Code)) }
```

- **Rich-text runs — per-run colour / weight / size (same channel).** `LabelText.Rich` carries a short
  ordered sequence of `LabelRun { Text; Color; Weight; Scale }` spans; each attribute is optional and
  inherits the default when `None`, so an all-default `Rich` ≡ the equivalent `plainLabel` byte-for-byte.
  Use it for an **emphasis hierarchy** (a loud bold callsign + a dim small code); colour / weight / size
  here, with **italic / underline / strike / letter-spacing** added by full rich-text layout below
  (per-glyph styling and per-run font family stay out of scope). Keep runs **few** and the
  palette **restrained**, and **do not colour a run to impersonate the faction/state pre-attentive
  encodings** — author colours are used as-is (never re-mapped) and the linter is unchanged, so this is a
  loop caveat, not a runtime rule. Each run is fitted in its own style, lines cap to the grammar budget and
  ellipsise surplus, and tofu-free output is a **render-edge** property (verify through `Symbology.Render`).

```fsharp
// A loud bold callsign next to a dim, smaller code — one styled label:
{ Symbology.defaultToken with
    R = 28.0
    Faction = Ally
    Label =
        Some(
            Symbology.richLabel
                [ { Symbology.run u.Callsign with Weight = Some 700 }
                  { Symbology.run ("  " + u.Code) with Scale = Some 0.7; Color = Some (Colors.rgb 150uy 150uy 150uy) } ]) }
```

- **Full rich-text layout — alignment / justification / explicit breaks + decoration (feature 199, same
  channel).** Each `LabelRun` also takes optional **`Italic` / `Underline` / `Strike` / `Tracking`**
  (each `None`/`false`/`0.0`-defaulted), and `LabelText.Laid of LabelParagraph list` carries explicit
  paragraphs, each `{ Runs; Align }` with **`Align = Leading | Center | Trailing | Justify`** (build with
  `Symbology.paragraph` / `align` / `laidLabel`). **`Center` is the default and reproduces the 198 flow
  byte-for-byte** (a single `Center` all-default paragraph ≡ the equivalent `richLabel`/`plainLabel`).
  `Justify` fills wrapped lines; the **last line of each paragraph** and any **single-token line** stay
  un-justified. Tracking is folded into measurement (never overflows); underline/strike follow each drawn
  fragment; lines cap+ellipsise under every alignment; empty paragraphs/runs drop and a degenerate token
  shows the placeholder. Keep paragraphs **short** and the alignment/decoration set **restrained** — don't
  let it crowd the region or impersonate the faction/state encodings (loop caveat, not a runtime rule);
  it stays **inspection-detail**, the linter is unchanged, and tofu-free is a **render-edge** property.

```fsharp
// A centred callsign over a justified descriptor and a struck-through retired code:
{ Symbology.defaultToken with
    R = 28.0
    Faction = Ally
    Label =
        Some(
            Symbology.laidLabel
                [ Symbology.align Center [ { Symbology.run u.Callsign with Weight = Some 700 } ]
                  Symbology.align Justify [ Symbology.run u.Descriptor ]
                  Symbology.align Trailing [ { Symbology.run u.RetiredCode with Strike = Some true } ] ]) }
```

- **Auto-label — derive the label from channels (feature 200, same channel).** Instead of hand-authoring a
  callsign, set `AutoLabel : AutoLabelSpec option` (`Symbology.autoLabel fields` / `autoLabelSep sep fields`)
  and the library projects a compact game-agnostic readout from the **`Token`'s own encoded channels**:
  `FactionCode` (ALY/ENY/NEU/CUS), `KlassCode` (MOB/HVY/SCT), `StateCode` (CFM/SUS), `HealthTier` (H+nn),
  `ThreatTier` (T0..T4), `SpeedPips` (S0..S4), `ShieldFlag` (SHD, dropped when off). An explicit `Label`
  **always wins**; identical channels ⇒ identical label; an empty/dropped projection ⇒ no label. Keep
  projections compact (2–3 fields — Ring is tightest) and don't impersonate the faction/state encodings.
  The per-game `'stats -> Token` mapping stays yours; auto-label reads only the encoded channels.

```fsharp
// A state readout projected from the unit's own channels — no callsign typed:
{ Symbology.defaultToken with R = 28.0; Faction = Ally; Health = 0.9; Speed = 2
                              AutoLabel = Some(Symbology.autoLabel [ FactionCode; HealthTier; SpeedPips ]) }
```

- **Label-bound motion — animate the resolved label (feature 200, no new clock).** Set
  `LabelMotion : LabelMotion option` (`LabelMotion.TypeOn | Fade | Pulse | Scroll`) and the resolved label
  (explicit or auto-derived) animates as a pure function of the **phase the board already supplies**
  (`animate`/`filmstrip`/`animateIn`/`filmstripIn`) — no signature change. At the rest phase it is
  **byte-identical to the static label**; it stays fitted and tofu-free at every phase; `Scroll` clips to
  the region (no overflow). Keep motion **restrained** — it is inspection-detail, the linter is unchanged.
  `AutoLabel = None` / `LabelMotion = None` are the defaults and are byte-identical to the pre-200 symbol.

## Selectable grammars (form factors) — one mapping, three drawings

The same `'stats -> Token` mapping drives three interchangeable **grammars**, chosen as a value
`Grammar = Token | Badge | Ring`. Switching grammar changes only the drawing — the ChannelMap is
**unchanged**:

- **Token** (`Grammar.Token`) — heading-rotated silhouette; the v1 default; prefer when motion/heading is primary.
- **Badge** (`Grammar.Badge`) — compact, **screen-aligned** framed emblem (class-driven frame, bottom health bar, speed pips, edge heading pip); prefer for dense insignia walls where an upright frame reads faster.
- **Ring** (`Grammar.Ring`) — centred **radial gauge** (outer ring hue/threat/state, health **arc sweep** monotone in health, rim speed beads, heading needle); prefer when continuous channels should read radially.

Render a selected grammar with `Symbology.render grammar token`; build boards with `galleryIn` /
`filmstripIn` / `animateIn` (the `gallery`/`filmstrip`/`animate` args, plus a leading `Grammar`).
Badge/Ring are screen-aligned (heading is a discrete indicator) and take only grammar-agnostic motion
overlays (Pulse/Blink/Damage; directional rhythms degrade to the static base). Because the mapping is
identical across grammars, the legibility linter's verdict is **grammar-independent**. `Grammar.Token`
reproduces the existing functions byte-for-byte.

## Legibility rules to critique against

Assign-by-urgency (urgent state on hue/motion/size); redundancy on critical state; one active motion at
a time; never critical state on dash alone; faction (saturated hue) and inspection state (dash) never
share the hue channel. Check: faction separable? class distinct? health readable at the target size?

CRITIQUE with two complementary checks: (a) LINT — run the linter on the produced symbol set
(`Legibility.score (roster |> List.map mapUnit)`; animated boards use `scoreAnimated` over the
`(motion, token)` pairs) and read `report.Verdict` / `report.Findings`. The linter is pure/deterministic
and the mechanical backstop: a `Warning`/`Error` names the overloaded or out-of-domain `Channel`,
used-vs-capacity, and the contributing unit indices. A non-`Clean` verdict is a TWEAK trigger — the unit
of change stays the mapping, never the grammar. (b) EYE — the human-style self-check of the PNG vs the
rules above stays (the linter cannot see crowding, contrast, or label collisions). The approved roster
lints `Clean`, so a fresh finding is a real signal to re-tune the mapping.

## Build Commands

Run `./fake.sh build -t Dev` then `./fake.sh build -t Verify` in this product.

## Test Commands

Run `./fake.sh build -t Test` to exercise product-owned symbology mappings and board examples.

## Evidence

Record each loop iteration's *timestamped board PNG* + *mapping snapshot* under this product's
`readiness/` paths. `Render.toPng` fails loud on any non-passing verdict, so a critique never reasons
over a blank image. Re-rendering an unchanged mapping is byte-identical (determinism).

## Package Boundary

`FS.GG.UI.Symbology` must not reference the viewer host, layout, widgets, or Elmish — keep all raster/IO
in `FS.GG.UI.Symbology.Render`. Keep the game-symbol vocabulary off the core control surface.

## Persistent problems

When a problem outlasts reasonable in-repo attempts, extensive external research is **mandatory** —
consult **official online docs first** (the F#/.NET docs and the driven library's own documentation),
then community sources. Record findings and resolving links in the feature's `specs/<feature>/feedback/`
folder. Offline, the mandate degrades to recording "research blocked — <why>" rather than hard-failing.
