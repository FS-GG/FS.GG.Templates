# Tetris

## 1. Overview
Tetris is a falling-block puzzle. Seven distinct four-cell pieces (tetrominoes) descend
one at a time into a narrow 10-wide, 20-tall well. The player slides and rotates each
piece as it falls, packing them into a flat, gapless stack. Completely filling a
horizontal row clears it and awards points; the rows above collapse down. The fantasy is
pure spatial mastery under escalating time pressure: the well never empties, gravity
accelerates with every level, and a single misplaced piece can cascade into a topped-out
board. The core verb is **place** — every second is a small optimization problem solved
with rotate, shift, and drop. It is fun because the rules are trivial to learn, the
inputs are instantaneous, and the difficulty curve is self-inflicted: you lose because
the board you built failed, not because the game cheated.

## 2. Core Game Loop
**Moment-to-moment loop:** spawn piece at top → fall under gravity → player shifts /
rotates / soft-drops / hard-drops → piece lands and locks → check & clear full lines →
score & maybe level-up → spawn next piece → repeat.

**Session-level loop:** title screen → press Start → play (loop above) until a new piece
cannot spawn (top-out) → game-over screen showing final score / lines / level → press
Restart → new game with reset state and a freshly shuffled bag.

A single game is one continuous descent with no levels to "complete"; the session ends
only on loss. Target session length ~10 minutes for a competent player.

## 3. Controls & Input
Keyboard is primary. Input model mixes **edge-triggered** (fire once on key-down) and
**held with auto-repeat** (DAS/ARR) actions.

| Input | Action | Model |
|---|---|---|
| ← Left Arrow | Move piece one cell left | Edge-trigger on press; then **DAS** auto-repeat while held |
| → Right Arrow | Move piece one cell right | Edge-trigger on press; then **DAS** auto-repeat while held |
| ↓ Down Arrow | Soft drop (accelerated fall) | Held: gravity multiplied while down is held |
| ↑ Up Arrow / X | Rotate clockwise (CW) | Edge-trigger (no auto-repeat) |
| Z / Ctrl | Rotate counter-clockwise (CCW) | Edge-trigger |
| Space | Hard drop (instant drop + lock) | Edge-trigger |
| C / Shift | Hold piece (swap with hold slot) | Edge-trigger, once per spawn |
| P / Esc | Pause / resume | Edge-trigger |
| Enter | Start / Restart (on title & game-over) | Edge-trigger |

**DAS (Delayed Auto Shift):** after a directional key is held for **DAS = 170 ms**, the
piece begins shifting repeatedly at **ARR (Auto Repeat Rate) = 50 ms** per cell until the
key releases or hits a wall. The very first shift happens immediately on key-down.

**Soft drop:** while ↓ is held, gravity interval is divided by the soft-drop factor
(20×, see §4.3); releasing returns to normal gravity. Soft drop never skips the lock
delay.

## 4. Mechanics (detailed)

### 4.1 The Well (playfield grid)
The board is a grid **10 columns × 20 visible rows**, plus **2 hidden buffer rows above**
the top (rows -1, -2) where pieces spawn. Total logical grid is 10×22, with rows 0–19
visible. Each cell is either `Empty` or `Filled of color`. Coordinates: column `x`
increases rightward 0→9; row `y` increases **downward** 0→21 (y=0 is top visible row, y=21
is floor row). Gravity moves pieces toward increasing `y`.

### 4.2 Tetrominoes
Exactly 7 pieces, each 4 cells, identified by letter with a fixed Tetris-guideline color:

| Piece | Color (hex) | Spawn shape (cells, relative) |
|---|---|---|
| I | Cyan `#00F0F0` | horizontal bar, 4 wide |
| O | Yellow `#F0F000` | 2×2 square |
| T | Purple `#A000F0` | 3-wide row + 1 above center |
| S | Green `#00F000` | top two cells right-shifted |
| Z | Red `#F00000` | top two cells left-shifted |
| J | Blue `#0000F0` | 3-wide row + 1 above left |
| L | Orange `#F0A000` | 3-wide row + 1 above right |

Spawn placement: pieces spawn horizontally, centered in columns 3–6, with the piece's
bounding box straddling the hidden buffer / top visible row. The **I** and **O** spawn in
columns 3–6 / 4–5 respectively per guideline. If any spawn cell overlaps a filled cell,
the game tops out (§11).

### 4.3 Gravity & dropping
- **Gravity** moves the active piece down one cell every **gravity interval** (a function
  of level, §6.2). Each step is collision-checked; if the cell below is blocked the piece
  does not move and the **lock timer** runs.
- **Soft drop:** while ↓ held, effective gravity interval = `gravityInterval / 20`
  (clamped to a minimum of one step per frame). Awards 1 point per cell soft-dropped.
- **Hard drop:** the piece teleports to its lowest legal position instantly and **locks
  immediately** (no lock delay). Awards 2 points per cell traveled.

### 4.4 Rotation (SRS) & wall kicks
Rotation uses the **Super Rotation System (SRS)**. Each piece has 4 rotation states:
`0` (spawn), `R` (CW from spawn), `2` (180°), `L` (CCW from spawn). Rotation pivots around
the piece's SRS center.
- **O** never effectively rotates (no offset).
- On a rotation attempt, the game tests the target orientation at 5 candidate offsets (the
  SRS **kick table**) in order; the first offset with no collision is applied. If all 5
  fail, the rotation is rejected and the piece is unchanged.
- **J, L, S, T, Z** share the standard JLSTZ kick table; **I** uses its own I kick table.
  Kick offsets are the guideline values, e.g. for JLSTZ `0→R`: `(0,0) (-1,0) (-1,+1) (0,-2) (-1,-2)`
  (x right-positive, y up-positive in kick-table convention; convert to the y-down grid by
  negating the y component).

A **simpler fallback** is acceptable for v1 if SRS is too costly: rotate around the
bounding-box center and try at most 3 kicks — `(0,0)`, `(-1,0)`, `(+1,0)` — rejecting the
rotation if none fit. The acceptance tests in §14 are written against the simpler model and
hold for SRS too.

### 4.5 Lock delay
When a piece rests on the stack (cell below blocked), a **lock timer = 500 ms** starts.
- If the player moves or rotates the piece into a position where it can still fall, the
  timer resets — but only up to **15 move/rotate resets** per piece; after 15 resets the
  next time it rests it locks immediately. This prevents infinite stalling.
- When the timer expires (or hard drop fires), the piece's cells are written into the grid
  permanently and line-clear evaluation runs.

### 4.6 Line clears
After a lock, scan all rows. Any row whose 10 cells are all `Filled` is **cleared**:
removed, with every row above it shifted down by one, and empty rows inserted at the top.
Clearing 1/2/3/4 rows simultaneously scores differently (§11). Four at once is a "Tetris".

### 4.7 7-bag randomizer
The piece sequence uses the **7-bag** system: take all 7 piece types, shuffle them
(Fisher–Yates with the seeded RNG), and deal them one at a time. When the bag empties,
refill and reshuffle. This guarantees every 7 spawns contain each piece exactly once — no
floods, no droughts longer than 12 pieces.

### 4.8 Hold & next queue
- **Next queue:** the upcoming pieces are previewed; show the next **5** pieces (drawn
  from the current + refilled bag).
- **Hold:** pressing Hold moves the active piece into the hold slot. If the slot was empty,
  the next piece spawns; if occupied, the held and active pieces swap and the swapped-in
  piece respawns at the top. Hold may be used **once per spawned piece** (a `holdUsed` flag
  resets when a new piece spawns from the queue, not from a swap).

## 5. Entities / Game Objects

### 5.1 Cell
The atomic grid unit. A cell is `Empty` or `Filled of PieceColor`. No behavior; it is data
read by the renderer and the line-clear scan.

### 5.2 Active Piece
The single falling tetromino. Properties: piece kind (`I O T S Z J L`), an `(x, y)` grid
origin, a rotation state (`0 R 2 L`), and a 0–15 lock-reset counter. Behavior is a small
state machine: **Falling** (gravity steps, accepts input) → **Resting** (lock timer
running, still accepts input that may return it to Falling) → **Locked** (cells committed,
piece destroyed, next spawns). Created by spawn (from queue or hold swap); destroyed on
lock.

```fsharp
type PieceKind = I | O | T | S | Z | J | L
type Rotation  = R0 | R1 | R2 | R3            // 0, R(90 CW), 2(180), L(270)

type Piece =
    { Kind     : PieceKind
      Pos      : int * int                    // grid origin (col x, row y)
      Rotation : Rotation
      LockResets : int }                       // 0..15

/// 4 occupied grid cells for a piece at its current pos+rotation
val cellsOf : Piece -> (int * int) list
```

### 5.3 Board / Well
A 2D array of cells, `10 wide × 22 tall` (rows 0–21; 0–19 visible). Created at game start
(all `Empty`); mutated only at lock (write piece cells) and clear (shift rows). It is the
source of truth for collision and rendering.

### 5.4 Bag / Queue
Holds the remaining shuffled pieces of the current bag plus enough of the next bag to show
5 previews. `next` pops the head and refills/reshuffles when low.

### 5.5 Hold slot
Optional single `PieceKind` plus the `holdUsed` flag.

## 6. World / Levels / Progression

### 6.1 Playfield dimensions
Logical render canvas **1280×720**. The well is centered: each cell is a **32×32 px**
square, so the 10×20 visible well is **320×640 px**, drawn at origin `(480, 40)`
(centered horizontally; 40 px top margin, 40 px bottom margin). Hold panel sits left of the
well; next-queue panel and score HUD sit to the right.

### 6.2 Levels & difficulty ramp
- The game starts at **level 0** (or a chosen start level 0–9).
- **Level up:** every **10 lines cleared** total increases the level by 1 (line counter is
  cumulative; level = `totalLines / 10`, capped at the start level as a floor).
- Higher level = faster gravity. Gravity interval per level (frames at 60 FPS, classic
  guideline-style curve), converted to seconds:

| Level | Frames/cell | Seconds/cell |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 48 | 0.800 |
| 1 | 43 | 0.717 |
| 2 | 38 | 0.633 |
| 3 | 33 | 0.550 |
| 4 | 28 | 0.467 |
| 5 | 23 | 0.383 |
| 6 | 18 | 0.300 |
| 7 | 13 | 0.217 |
| 8 | 8 | 0.133 |
| 9 | 6 | 0.100 |
| 10–12 | 5 | 0.083 |
| 13–15 | 4 | 0.067 |
| 16–18 | 3 | 0.050 |
| 19–28 | 2 | 0.033 |
| 29+ | 1 | 0.017 |

The only thing that changes over time is gravity speed (and thus required reaction time).
The board, scoring multipliers, and piece set are constant.

## 7. State Model (Elmish/MVU)

### 7.1 Model
```fsharp
type Phase = Title | Playing | Paused | GameOver

type Model =
    { Phase        : Phase
      Board        : Cell[,]            // [22, 10]  (rows, cols); rows 0-19 visible
      Active       : Piece option        // None between lock and spawn
      Bag          : PieceKind list      // remaining shuffled pieces (>= 5 buffered)
      Hold         : PieceKind option
      HoldUsed     : bool
      Score        : int
      Lines        : int                 // cumulative cleared lines
      Level        : int
      StartLevel   : int
      // timers (seconds)
      GravityAcc   : float               // accumulates dt; steps when >= gravityInterval
      LockTimer    : float option        // Some t = resting, counting down from 0.5
      DasTimer     : float               // for held left/right auto-shift
      Dir          : int                 // -1 left, 0 none, +1 right (held direction)
      SoftDrop     : bool
      Rng          : System.Random       // seeded
      HighScore    : int }
```

### 7.2 Msg
```fsharp
type Msg =
    | Tick of float                       // dt in seconds, ~1/60
    | MoveLeftDown | MoveLeftUp
    | MoveRightDown | MoveRightUp
    | SoftDropDown | SoftDropUp
    | RotateCW | RotateCCW
    | HardDrop
    | HoldPiece
    | TogglePause
    | StartGame                           // from Title / GameOver
```

### 7.3 update (key transitions)
- **`StartGame`**: reset Board to empty, shuffle a fresh bag from `Rng`, spawn first piece,
  `Phase = Playing`, zero score/lines, level = StartLevel.
- **`Tick dt`** (only when `Playing`):
  1. Advance `DasTimer` if `Dir <> 0`; when it crosses DAS, shift one cell every ARR.
  2. Add `dt` to `GravityAcc`; while `GravityAcc >= interval` (interval = soft-drop-adjusted
     gravity for current level) subtract and step the piece down one cell if legal.
  3. If the piece cannot move down: if `LockTimer = None` start it at 0.5; else decrement by
     `dt`; on ≤ 0 → **lock** (write cells, clear lines, score, spawn next, reset `HoldUsed`).
  4. If a downward step succeeded while resting, clear `LockTimer` (reset, counting a
     lock-reset, capped at 15).
- **`MoveLeftDown`/`MoveRightDown`**: set `Dir`, immediately try one shift; reset DAS timer.
  **`...Up`**: if it matches current `Dir`, set `Dir = 0`.
- **`RotateCW`/`RotateCCW`**: attempt SRS rotation with kick tests; on success, if resting,
  reset lock timer (count a reset).
- **`HardDrop`**: drop to lowest legal y, add 2×cells-traveled to score, lock immediately.
- **`HoldPiece`**: if not `HoldUsed`, swap active with hold (or pull from queue), respawn at
  top, set `HoldUsed = true`.
- **`TogglePause`**: `Playing ↔ Paused` (ignore other gameplay msgs while Paused).
- On lock that causes a spawn collision → `Phase = GameOver`, update `HighScore`.

### 7.4 view
`view` is pure: it reads the Model and emits draw commands (it does not mutate). It renders
the well grid, the locked cells, the ghost piece, the active piece, hold panel, next-queue,
and HUD text. Phase selects the screen (title / play / pause overlay / game-over). Skia
performs the actual GPU drawing from these commands.

### 7.5 Subscriptions
- **Tick:** a 60 FPS timer dispatching `Tick dt` with `dt` in seconds (target 0.0167 s);
  clamp `dt` to ≤ 0.05 s to avoid gravity jumps after a stall.
- **Input:** keyboard key-down → the edge-triggered / `...Down` messages; key-up → `...Up`
  messages for held keys (left/right/soft-drop).

## 8. Rendering (Skia 2D)
Coordinate system: origin top-left, +x right, +y down, logical 1280×720 (Skia scales to the
window). Single full redraw each frame (the board is small; no dirty-rect optimization
needed).

**Draw order (back to front):**
1. **Background** — solid `#101018` fill over the whole canvas.
2. **Well frame** — well background `#000000` rectangle at `(480,40)` size `320×640`; a
   1 px grid of `#202028` lines between cells; a 2 px border `#404050` around the well.
3. **Locked cells** — for each filled grid cell, a 32×32 rounded-rect (corner 3 px) in the
   piece color, with a lighter top-left bevel (`+20%` lightness) and darker bottom-right
   bevel (`-20%`) for a beveled-block look.
4. **Ghost piece** — the active piece projected to its hard-drop landing row, drawn as
   outlines / 30%-alpha fills in the piece color, so the player sees where it will land.
5. **Active piece** — same block style as locked cells, at its live position.
6. **Side panels** — Hold panel (left, at `(120,40)`, 200×120) and Next-queue panel (right,
   at `(840,40)`, 200×420) each with a `#181820` background, `#404050` border, and a label.
   Pieces drawn at half scale (16 px cells) inside.
7. **HUD text** — score / lines / level (see §9), white `#FFFFFF`, monospace font.
8. **Overlays** — pause dimmer (`#000000` at 60% alpha + "PAUSED") or game-over panel.

Line-clear visual effect: on a clear, flash the cleared rows white for ~120 ms (a short
animation timer) before collapsing — optional in v1 but specified for polish.

## 9. UI / HUD / Screens

**Screens:**
- **Title:** game name centered (~64 px), "Press Enter to Start" prompt, high score shown.
- **Play:** the well + panels + HUD (below).
- **Pause:** play screen frozen under a 60% dimmer with centered "PAUSED".
- **Game Over:** centered "GAME OVER", final Score / Lines / Level, "New High Score!" if
  beaten, and "Press Enter to Restart".

**HUD (during play):** right column, below the next-queue panel, monospace, right-aligned:
- `SCORE` — current score, zero-padded to 7 digits (e.g. `0012300`).
- `LINES` — cumulative lines cleared.
- `LEVEL` — current level.
- `HIGH` — session/persisted high score.
- **Hold** label above the hold panel; **Next** label above the queue panel.

## 10. Audio
Checklist (audio optional in v1):
- [ ] Piece move (left/right shift) — short tick.
- [ ] Rotate — soft click.
- [ ] Soft drop — subtle tick per cell.
- [ ] Hard drop — thud.
- [ ] Lock — light clack.
- [ ] Line clear (1–3) — chime.
- [ ] Tetris (4 lines) — bigger fanfare.
- [ ] Level up — ascending cue.
- [ ] Hold — swap whoosh.
- [ ] Game over — descending tone.
- [ ] Music — looping "Korobeiniki"-style theme; tempo optionally rises with level.

## 11. Win / Loss / Scoring
**No win condition** — Tetris is endless; the goal is the highest score before topping out.

**Loss (top-out):** the game ends when a newly spawned piece overlaps an already-filled cell
(the stack has reached the spawn zone). `Phase → GameOver`.

**Scoring (line clears, multiplied by `level + 1`):**

| Event | Base points | At level n |
|---|---|---|
| Single (1 line) | 100 | `100 × (n+1)` |
| Double (2 lines) | 300 | `300 × (n+1)` |
| Triple (3 lines) | 500 | `500 × (n+1)` |
| Tetris (4 lines) | 800 | `800 × (n+1)` |
| Soft drop | 1 per cell | (not multiplied) |
| Hard drop | 2 per cell | (not multiplied) |

Lives/continues: none. One game = one descent.

## 12. Difficulty & Balancing
Data-driven tunables:

| Parameter | Default | Range | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `boardWidth` | 10 | 6–14 | Well width (cols) |
| `boardHeight` | 20 | 10–30 | Visible well height (rows) |
| `cellPx` | 32 | 16–48 | On-screen cell size |
| `dasMs` | 170 | 80–300 | Delay before auto-shift |
| `arrMs` | 50 | 0–120 | Auto-shift repeat rate |
| `lockDelayMs` | 500 | 200–1000 | Rest time before lock |
| `maxLockResets` | 15 | 5–30 | Anti-stall cap |
| `softDropFactor` | 20 | 2–40 | Gravity divisor while ↓ held |
| `linesPerLevel` | 10 | 5–20 | Lines to advance a level |
| `startLevel` | 0 | 0–19 | Initial gravity level |
| `nextPreview` | 5 | 1–6 | Visible upcoming pieces |
| `gravityCurve` | §6.2 | — | Seconds/cell per level table |

## 13. Technical Notes
- **Performance budget:** at most ~220 drawn cells (board 200 + active 4 + ghost 4 + panel
  previews) plus HUD text — trivially within a 16.7 ms frame at 60 FPS.
- **Timestep:** **fixed-logic, variable-render** — accumulate `dt` into `GravityAcc` so
  gravity is frame-rate independent; clamp `dt ≤ 0.05 s`. DAS/ARR and lock timers are also
  `dt`-accumulated.
- **Determinism / RNG:** all randomness (7-bag shuffle) flows through one seeded
  `System.Random`. Given the same seed and input sequence, the game is fully reproducible —
  essential for the acceptance tests below.
- **Persistence:** high score persisted to local storage / a settings file; loaded on title,
  written on game over if beaten.
- **Edge cases:** (a) rotation against a wall/floor uses kicks; if no kick fits, rotation is
  rejected, not clipped. (b) Hard drop into the spawn zone still locks then triggers top-out
  on next spawn. (c) Soft drop must never skip the lock delay (so a row can still be cleared
  after a fast drop). (d) Hold cannot be spammed (one use per piece). (e) Simultaneous
  multi-row clears must be detected in a single scan (a Tetris is one event, not four
  singles).

## 14. Acceptance Criteria (test scenarios)
All scenarios assume a fixed RNG seed and the default tunables unless stated.

1. **Spawn & fall.** *Given* a new game, *when* the first piece spawns, *then* it appears
   centered in columns 3–6 at the top and descends one cell per gravity interval for the
   current level (level 0 → one cell every 0.800 s ± one frame).

2. **Horizontal move & wall block.** *Given* a piece mid-board, *when* the player presses
   Left, *then* it shifts exactly one cell left; *when* it is against column 0 and Left is
   pressed, *then* it does not move and stays at column 0.

3. **DAS auto-shift.** *Given* Left held continuously, *when* 170 ms have elapsed, *then* the
   piece begins shifting one cell every 50 ms until release or a wall.

4. **Rotation with wall kick.** *Given* a piece flush against the right wall in an
   orientation that would clip the wall when rotated CW, *when* Rotate CW is pressed, *then*
   the piece kicks left into a legal position and rotates; *and if* no kick offset fits,
   *then* the piece's rotation and position are unchanged.

5. **Soft drop scoring.** *Given* a piece N cells above the stack, *when* ↓ is held until it
   lands, *then* gravity is ~20× faster and the score increases by N (1 point per soft-drop
   cell).

6. **Hard drop.** *Given* a piece with M cells of clear space below, *when* Space is pressed,
   *then* the piece instantly moves to the lowest legal row, locks immediately (no 500 ms
   delay), and the score increases by `2 × M`.

7. **Lock delay & reset.** *Given* a piece resting on the stack, *when* it has rested for
   500 ms with no input, *then* it locks; *but when* the player rotates or shifts it into a
   still-fallable position before 500 ms, *then* the lock timer resets — up to 15 times,
   after which it locks on next rest regardless.

8. **Single line clear & scoring.** *Given* row 19 has 9 of 10 cells filled and a piece fills
   the gap, *when* it locks, *then* exactly that row clears, rows above shift down one, and
   the score increases by `100 × (level + 1)`.

9. **Tetris (four-line) clear.** *Given* four stacked rows each missing only column 9 and a
   vertical I piece dropped into column 9, *when* it locks, *then* all four rows clear in a
   single event and the score increases by `800 × (level + 1)`.

10. **Level up & gravity change.** *Given* the player has cleared 9 lines at level 0, *when* a
    clear brings the cumulative total to 10, *then* the level becomes 1 and the gravity
    interval drops to 0.717 s/cell.

11. **7-bag fairness.** *Given* a fresh game, *when* the first 7 pieces are spawned, *then*
    each of the 7 tetromino kinds appears exactly once (in some order); *and* across any
    14 consecutive pieces, no kind appears more than twice.

12. **Hold piece, once per spawn.** *Given* an active piece and an empty hold slot, *when*
    Hold is pressed, *then* the piece moves to hold and the next-queue piece spawns; *when*
    Hold is pressed again before the new piece locks, *then* nothing happens (one hold per
    spawned piece).

13. **Next queue preview.** *Given* play in progress, *when* the current piece locks, *then*
    the piece previously shown first in the 5-deep next queue becomes active and the queue
    shifts up by one, revealing a new 5th preview.

14. **Top-out / game over.** *Given* the stack reaches the spawn zone, *when* the next piece
    would spawn onto an already-filled cell, *then* the game transitions to GameOver, the
    final score/lines/level are shown, and the high score updates if beaten.

15. **Pause freezes state.** *Given* play in progress with an active piece mid-fall, *when*
    Pause is pressed, *then* gravity, timers, and input are suspended and the board is shown
    dimmed; *when* Pause is pressed again, *then* play resumes from the identical state.

16. **Determinism.** *Given* the same RNG seed and the same recorded input sequence with
    timestamps, *when* the game is replayed, *then* the final board, score, lines, and level
    are identical to the original run.

## 15. Stretch Goals
1. **Ghost piece toggle & hold-to-rotate options** — accessibility/preference settings.
2. **Line-clear and lock animations** — flash + collapse tween, particle burst on Tetris.
3. **T-spin detection & bonus scoring** — reward kicked-in T placements (TSS/TSD/TST).
4. **Back-to-back & combo multipliers** — chained Tetrises / consecutive clears bonus.
5. **Marathon / Sprint (40-line) / Ultra (2-min) modes** — alternate goals & timers.
6. **Garbage / versus mode** — sent lines for local or networked 2-player.
7. **Replays & leaderboards** — record the deterministic input stream; persist top runs.

Tetris uses the **generic FS.GG game shell** (FS-GG/FS.GG.Rendering#991) — the same
menu/start screen and settings every FS.GG game shares — rather than a bespoke per-game
menu. Tetris supplies only its **name**, its **key→command map** (the rebindable actions
from §3 Controls), and its play `update`/`view`; the shell provides everything below.

- **Main menu / start screen** — the game's name (**Tetris**) as the title label, with
  **Start**, **Config**, and **Exit**. This supersedes the bespoke Title-screen "Press Enter
  to Start" affordance of §9 for launching a game.
- **`Esc` from gameplay** opens the pause menu (Resume · Config · Exit to menu) over the same
  shell; `Esc` again resumes. This is the shell home for the §3 `P` / `Esc` pause toggle and
  the §9 Pause overlay.
- **Config / Settings**, all applied live and persisted across restarts:
  - **Screen resolution** and **fullscreen** (windowed / borderless / fullscreen), driven
    through the SkiaViewer window-behavior + `LogicalCanvas` letterbox seam — the same seam
    that scales the logical 1280×720 canvas and centered well (§6.1, §8) to the window.
  - **Key rebinding** — the player remaps Tetris' controls (the §3 actions: move left/right,
    soft drop, rotate CW/CCW, hard drop, hold, pause, start/restart) via the
    `Controls.KeyRebind` UI over the `KeyboardInput.Keymap` mechanism; bindings persist via
    `KeymapCodec` (JSON), beside Tetris' other saved config (e.g. the persisted high score and
    start level, §13).
  - (Game-specific rows such as start level or volume may be added as extra Config rows, but
    the menu, Esc routing, display settings, and rebind screen come from the shell.)

The shell is pointer- and keyboard-navigable over the interactive Controls host (the
`fs-gg-skiaviewer` "game → pointer host" recipe). It is a shared dependency, so Tetris does
**not** re-specify menu-stack/cursor/settings machinery of its own.

## 16. Milestone Roadmap

Delivery is milestone-sequenced (M0..Mn), each a small, demonstrable slice grounded in the
sections above. Earlier milestones stand up the deterministic simulation core; later ones
layer feel, the shared shell, audio, and the acceptance harness.

### M0 — Scaffold & fixed-step loop
Stand up the Elmish/MVU app (§7) on the FS.GG.Rendering host: the `Model`/`Msg` skeleton, the
60 FPS `Tick` subscription dispatching `Tick dt` in seconds with `dt` clamped to ≤ 0.05 s
(§7.5), and an empty 1280×720 logical canvas (§6.1, §8) that clears to `#101018` every frame.
No gameplay yet — just a deterministic, steppable loop with `Phase = Title`.

### M1 — The well, tetrominoes & spawn
Build the 10×22 grid (10×20 visible + 2 hidden buffer rows, §4.1) and the 7 guideline
tetrominoes with their colors and spawn shapes (§4.2): centered spawn in columns 3–6, the
top-out collision check, and `cellsOf` for a piece at a given pos + rotation (§5.2).

### M2 — Horizontal movement (DAS/ARR) & gravity
Implement piece control (§3, §4.3): edge-trigger shift on key-down then DAS = 170 ms delay →
ARR = 50 ms repeat while held, collision-checked left/right; gravity stepping one cell per
level-derived interval; soft drop (`interval / 20`, +1 pt/cell) while ↓ held; and hard drop
(teleport to lowest legal row, lock immediately, +2 pts/cell).

### M3 — Rotation (SRS) & wall kicks
Implement the Super Rotation System (§4.4): the four rotation states, the JLSTZ and I kick
tables tested at 5 candidate offsets (first collision-free applied, else rejected), O never
rotating — with the simpler 3-kick fallback documented as acceptable for v1.

### M4 — Lock delay
Add the 500 ms lock timer (§4.5): starts when the cell below is blocked, resets on a
move/rotate that lets the piece fall again but only up to 15 resets per piece, then locks
(writing cells to the grid and triggering line-clear evaluation) on expiry or hard drop.

### M5 — Line clears & scoring
Scan for full rows after each lock and clear them, shifting rows above down and inserting empty
rows at top (§4.6). Score Single / Double / Triple / Tetris at `100 / 300 / 500 / 800 × (level+1)`
plus soft/hard-drop points (§11), with the optional ~120 ms white flash before collapse (§8).

### M6 — 7-bag randomizer, hold & next queue
Add the seeded 7-bag Fisher–Yates randomizer (§4.7), the 5-piece next-queue preview (§4.8), and
the hold slot: swap active ↔ hold (or pull from queue) with the once-per-spawn `holdUsed` flag
that resets on a fresh spawn but not on a swap.

### M7 — Levels & gravity ramp
Wire the level curve (§6.2): start at level 0–9, level up every 10 cumulative lines, and drive
the gravity interval from the per-level frames/cell table (0.800 s at L0 down to 0.017 s at
L29+). Board, scoring multipliers, and piece set stay constant — only gravity speed changes.

### M8 — Rendering, ghost piece & HUD
Complete the back-to-front draw list (§8): well frame + grid, beveled locked cells, the 30%-alpha
ghost piece at its hard-drop landing row, the live active piece, the Hold and Next side panels at
half scale, and the HUD (score / lines / level / high, §9) plus the Title / Pause / Game Over
overlays.

### M9 — Menus, settings & key rebinding (shared game shell)
Adopt the generic game shell (FS-GG/FS.GG.Rendering#991): main menu (title **Tetris** +
Start/Config/Exit), `Esc` pause routing (Resume · Config · Exit to menu), Settings with screen
resolution + fullscreen through the SkiaViewer + `LogicalCanvas` letterbox seam, and in-game key
rebinding of the §3 controls, persisted via `KeymapCodec`. Tetris provides its name + key→command
map + play `update`/`view`; the shell provides the rest. No bespoke menu system — this replaces
the ad-hoc Title/Pause launch affordances of §9.

### M10 — Audio
Wire the SFX checklist (§10): move tick, rotate click, soft-drop tick, hard-drop thud, lock
clack, line-clear chime, the bigger Tetris fanfare, level-up cue, hold whoosh, game-over tone,
and the optional looping theme whose tempo may rise with level.

### M11 — Acceptance & determinism
Land the acceptance harness against the §14 scenarios: spawn/top-out, DAS/ARR shifting, gravity
and soft/hard drop, rotation + kicks, lock-delay reset cap, line clears and per-clear scoring,
7-bag distribution, hold once-per-spawn, level-up gravity change — and the seeded + input-log
**determinism** replay yielding identical final Score / Lines / Level and board state (§13).
