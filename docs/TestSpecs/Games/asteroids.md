# Asteroids

## 1. Overview
You pilot a fragile vector-drawn spaceship adrift in a wrap-around asteroid field.
The core verb is **shoot-and-survive**: tap the thruster to drift, rotate to aim, and
fire bullets that shatter big rocks into smaller, faster ones. Every shot makes the
field more crowded and more dangerous before it gets clearer, so the fun is the
escalating tension of momentum management — you can never fully stop, the screen wraps,
and a stray rock or a sniping UFO ends a life in one hit. It is a 45-second-per-wave
score chase that rewards precise thrust discipline and trigger control.

## 2. Core Game Loop
**Moment-to-moment:** rotate to aim → thrust to reposition → shoot asteroid → asteroid
splits → dodge the new fragments → repeat until the wave is clear.

**Session-level:** Title screen → press Start → spawn wave 1 (4 large asteroids) →
clear all rocks (and any UFO) → next wave (+1 large asteroid, faster) → keep clearing
until all 3 lives are lost → Game Over screen showing final score → press Start to
restart (RNG reseeded). Extra life awarded every 10,000 points.

## 3. Controls & Input
Keyboard is primary. Input is sampled each tick; rotation and thrust are **held**
(continuous while down), fire and hyperspace are **edge-triggered** (one action per
key-down, ignore auto-repeat).

| Input | Key | Action | Model |
|-------|-----|--------|-------|
| Rotate left | `Left Arrow` / `A` | Turn ship CCW | Held |
| Rotate right | `Right Arrow` / `D` | Turn ship CW | Held |
| Thrust | `Up Arrow` / `W` | Apply forward acceleration | Held |
| Fire | `Space` | Spawn one bullet | Edge (key-down) |
| Hyperspace | `Left Shift` / `H` | Teleport to random location | Edge (key-down) |
| Start / Restart | `Enter` | Begin game / restart from Game Over | Edge (key-down) |
| Pause | `Esc` / `P` | Toggle pause overlay | Edge (key-down) |

No mouse or gamepad in v1 (see Stretch Goals). There is **no reverse thrust and no
brake** — you bleed speed only via drag.

## 4. Mechanics (detailed)
All physics run on a fixed timestep `dt = 1/60 s`. Positions are in logical pixels on a
1280×720 toroidal playfield. Angles are stored in **radians**, rotation rates quoted in
deg/s for readability.

### 4.1 Ship movement
- **Rotation rate:** 270 deg/s (= 4.712 rad/s). Holding rotate applies
  `heading += ±rotRate * dt`. Heading 0 points to screen-right (+x); the ship nose
  vector is `(cos heading, sin heading)`.
- **Thrust acceleration:** 220 px/s² along the nose vector while Thrust held.
  `vel += noseVec * thrustAccel * dt`.
- **Drag (linear damping):** velocity multiplied by `0.99` every tick
  (≈ `0.547` per second; i.e. `vel *= dragPerTick` with `dragPerTick = 0.99`). This
  gives a long, floaty glide that never quite reaches zero — by design.
- **Max speed:** 600 px/s. After integrating, clamp `|vel|` to `maxSpeed`.
- **Position integration:** `pos += vel * dt`, then apply screen wrap (§4.6).

### 4.2 Firing & bullets
- **Bullet speed:** 700 px/s, added to the ship's current velocity at spawn so shots
  inherit ship momentum (muzzle velocity is `vel + noseVec * 700`). Speed is **not**
  clamped to ship max speed.
- **Spawn point:** ship nose tip = `pos + noseVec * 16` (ship is 16 px from center to
  nose).
- **Cooldown:** 250 ms minimum between shots (max 4 shots/s).
- **Max concurrent bullets:** 4. If 4 are already alive, Fire is ignored even if
  cooldown elapsed.
- **Lifetime:** 1.1 s, after which the bullet despawns. (At 700 px/s relative this
  travels ~770 px — a little over half the screen width, so you cannot snipe across the
  whole field.)
- **Bullet radius (hitbox):** 2 px. Bullets wrap on screen edges like everything else.

### 4.3 Asteroid splitting
Asteroids exist in three size classes. Shooting one removes it and (if not Small)
spawns **2 children** of the next size down.

| Size | Collision radius | Speed range | Children on death | Points |
|------|------------------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Large | 40 px | 20–60 px/s | 2 × Medium | 20 |
| Medium | 20 px | 40–90 px/s | 2 × Small | 50 |
| Small | 10 px | 60–130 px/s | none | 100 |

**Split behavior:** each child inherits the parent's position. Its velocity direction is
the parent's velocity heading rotated by a random offset in `±[15°, 45°]` (one child
each side), with a fresh speed magnitude drawn from the child class's speed range. Each
asteroid also has a slow visual spin: random angular velocity in `±[20, 90] deg/s`
(cosmetic only, does not affect the circular hitbox).

### 4.4 Collisions
All collisions are **circle vs circle**: overlap when
`distance(a, b) < a.radius + b.radius` (using wrap-aware shortest distance, §4.6).

- **Bullet ↔ Asteroid:** asteroid splits/dies, bullet despawns, score awarded.
- **Bullet ↔ UFO:** UFO dies, bullet despawns, score awarded.
- **Ship ↔ Asteroid:** ship destroyed (lose a life).
- **Ship ↔ UFO / UFO bullet:** ship destroyed.
- **UFO bullet ↔ Asteroid:** pass through (no interaction) to keep the UFO threatening.
- **Ship ↔ ship's own bullets:** never collide.
- Ship hitbox is a single circle of **radius 11 px** (smaller than the visual triangle,
  which feels fair).

### 4.5 Death, respawn & invulnerability
- On ship death: decrement lives, emit explosion particles, freeze ship for 1.5 s, then
  respawn at screen center with zero velocity and heading `-90°` (pointing up).
- **Respawn safety:** the ship will not un-freeze until the center 120×120 px area is
  clear of asteroids/UFO; check each tick after the 1.5 s timer.
- **Spawn invulnerability:** 2.5 s after respawn the ship is invulnerable (ignores all
  Ship↔X collisions) and renders blinking (toggle visibility every 100 ms).
- If lives reach 0, transition to Game Over.

### 4.6 Screen wrapping (toroidal space)
The playfield is a torus of width `W = 1280`, height `H = 720`. Applies to ship,
bullets, asteroids, UFO, and particles.

```
// position wrap (per axis), after integration
let wrap (v: float) (size: float) =
    let m = v % size
    if m < 0.0 then m + size else m
pos.X <- wrap pos.X W
pos.Y <- wrap pos.Y H
```

**Wrap-aware distance** (shortest toroidal delta) used for all collision checks and the
UFO's aim:
```
let wrapDelta (a: float) (b: float) (size: float) =
    let d = b - a
    if d >  size / 2.0 then d - size
    elif d < -size / 2.0 then d + size
    else d
// dist² = (wrapDelta ax bx W)² + (wrapDelta ay by H)²
```

Objects must also render duplicated near edges (§8) so a body straddling a boundary is
visible on both sides.

### 4.7 Hyperspace
Pressing Hyperspace instantly teleports the ship to a uniformly random position in the
playfield and zeroes its velocity. It is an emergency escape with risk:
- **Cooldown:** 1.0 s.
- **Re-entry risk:** 12% chance the ship is destroyed on arrival (a "bad warp"),
  resolved *after* placement. Otherwise the ship is briefly (0.3 s) invulnerable on
  arrival so it never instantly dies to a rock it landed on (except via the 12% roll).
- No directional control over destination.

### 4.8 UFO enemy
A flying saucer crosses the field and shoots at the ship.
- **Spawn:** after 30 s of a wave with no UFO present, OR once the wave is down to ≤ 3
  asteroids — whichever first. Max 1 UFO at a time. At most 1 UFO spawn attempt per 20 s.
- **Two types** (chosen at spawn): **Large** (radius 18 px, 200 pts, fires in a random
  direction) and **Small** (radius 10 px, 1000 pts, aims directly at the ship with up to
  ±10° error). Small-UFO probability rises with score: `min(0.75, score / 40000)`.
- **Movement:** enters from a random vertical position on the left or right edge, travels
  horizontally at 120 px/s, and every 1.0 s may jog its vertical velocity to one of
  `{-90, 0, +90} px/s` for a zig-zag path. Despawns when it exits the opposite edge
  (UFOs do **not** wrap horizontally; they do wrap vertically).
- **Firing:** one bullet every 1.2 s. UFO bullet speed 350 px/s, lifetime 1.4 s,
  radius 2 px.

## 5. Entities / Game Objects
F#-flavored sketches; final field names may differ.

### 5.1 Ship
```fsharp
type Ship =
  { Pos: Vec2
    Vel: Vec2
    Heading: float          // radians
    Thrusting: bool         // for flame rendering
    InvulnUntil: float      // game-time seconds; 0 if not invulnerable
    FireCooldown: float     // seconds remaining
    HyperCooldown: float
    Alive: bool
    RespawnTimer: float }   // >0 while frozen/dead before respawn
```
Created once at game start and on each respawn. Destroyed (Alive=false) on collision.

### 5.2 Asteroid
```fsharp
type AstSize = Large | Medium | Small
type Asteroid =
  { Pos: Vec2; Vel: Vec2
    Size: AstSize
    Radius: float
    Spin: float             // deg/s, cosmetic
    Angle: float            // current render rotation (rad)
    Shape: Vec2[] }         // pre-baked jagged polygon (8–12 verts), unit-scaled
```
Created at wave start (Large only) and on split (children). Destroyed when shot or when
it collides with the ship.

### 5.3 Bullet
```fsharp
type BulletOwner = Player | Ufo
type Bullet =
  { Pos: Vec2; Vel: Vec2
    Life: float             // seconds remaining
    Owner: BulletOwner }
```

### 5.4 Ufo
```fsharp
type UfoKind = LargeSaucer | SmallSaucer
type Ufo =
  { Pos: Vec2; Vel: Vec2
    Kind: UfoKind
    Radius: float
    FireTimer: float
    JogTimer: float
    ExitEdge: float }       // x at which it despawns
```

### 5.5 Particle (explosions / thrust)
```fsharp
type Particle =
  { Pos: Vec2; Vel: Vec2; Life: float; MaxLife: float }
```
Short-lived debris lines for ship/asteroid explosions and thrust exhaust. Cosmetic only,
no collisions; capped at 200 live particles.

## 6. World / Levels / Progression
- **Playfield:** 1280×720 logical px, toroidal (wraps both axes). No camera, no scroll.
- **Waves:** Wave `n` spawns `min(4 + (n - 1), 11)` Large asteroids (capped at 11).
  Large asteroids spawn at random edge positions, never within 150 px of the ship's
  spawn center, with random initial velocities in the Large speed range.
- **A wave clears** when there are zero asteroids AND no UFO on screen. After a 2.0 s
  pause the next wave spawns.
- **Difficulty ramp per wave:**
  - Asteroid base speed range scales by `min(1.6, 1 + 0.06 * (n - 1))`.
  - Small-UFO bias grows with score (§4.8).
  - UFO appears sooner as `n` rises: spawn delay `max(8, 30 - 2 * (n - 1))` seconds.
- Nothing else changes (ship stats are constant), keeping it "simple".

## 7. State Model (Elmish/MVU)

### Model
```fsharp
type Phase = Title | Playing | Paused | GameOver

type Model =
  { Phase: Phase
    Ship: Ship
    Asteroids: Asteroid list
    Bullets: Bullet list
    Ufo: Ufo option
    Particles: Particle list
    Score: int
    Lives: int
    Wave: int
    NextExtraLifeAt: int        // e.g. 10000, then 20000, ...
    Time: float                 // accumulated game-time seconds
    WaveClearTimer: float       // >0 during inter-wave pause
    UfoSpawnTimer: float
    Keys: Set<Key>              // currently-held keys
    Rng: System.Random
    HighScore: int }
```

### Msg
```fsharp
type Msg =
  | Tick of float               // dt in seconds (fixed 1/60)
  | KeyDown of Key
  | KeyUp of Key
  | StartGame
  | TogglePause
```

### update (key cases)
- **`Tick dt`** (only when `Phase = Playing`): the simulation step, in order:
  1. Apply held rotation/thrust to ship; integrate ship vel/pos; apply drag, clamp
     max speed, wrap.
  2. Integrate asteroids, bullets, UFO, particles; wrap; decay lifetimes/timers.
  3. UFO logic: spawn check, jog/zig-zag, fire timer.
  4. Collision resolution (bullets→rocks/UFO→split & score; ship→hazards→death).
  5. Wave-clear check → `WaveClearTimer`; next-wave spawn when it elapses.
  6. Extra-life check (`Score ≥ NextExtraLifeAt`).
  7. Respawn/invulnerability timers; `Lives = 0` → `Phase = GameOver`,
     update `HighScore`.
- **`KeyDown k`**: add to `Keys`; if edge action (Fire/Hyperspace/Pause/Start) handle
  once here (respecting cooldowns). Fire spawns a bullet if `< 4` alive and cooldown 0.
- **`KeyUp k`**: remove from `Keys`.
- **`StartGame`**: reset Model to a fresh game (lives=3, score=0, wave=1, reseed Rng),
  `Phase = Playing`.
- **`TogglePause`**: `Playing ↔ Paused` (Tick is a no-op while Paused).

### view
Pure projection of `Model` → a scene description Skia draws (§8). The view holds no
mutable state and performs no physics — it reads ship/asteroid/bullet/UFO/particle lists
plus HUD numbers and emits draw commands.

### Subscriptions
- A 60 FPS timer subscription dispatching `Tick (1/60)` (fixed timestep; see §13 for
  accumulator handling under variable real frame times).
- Keyboard subscription dispatching `KeyDown`/`KeyUp`.

## 8. Rendering (Skia 2D)
Coordinate system: origin top-left, +x right, +y down, logical 1280×720 (scaled to the
window). Classic vector look: black background, thin bright strokes, no fills.

**Draw order (back to front):**
1. **Background** — solid black `#000000` full-rect clear each frame.
2. **Particles** — 1 px lines, color `#AAAAAA` fading alpha by `Life/MaxLife`.
3. **Asteroids** — closed polygons from `Shape` rotated by `Angle`, stroke `#FFFFFF`,
   1.5 px width, no fill.
4. **UFO** — saucer outline (two stacked trapezoids + dome), stroke `#FF5555`, 1.5 px.
5. **Bullets** — 2 px filled squares/dots; player `#FFFFFF`, UFO `#FF5555`.
6. **Ship** — isosceles triangle (nose 16 px ahead of center, tail corners ±10 px),
   stroke `#00FFAA`, 2 px; when `Thrusting`, draw a flickering exhaust triangle behind
   the tail in `#FFAA00`. Skip drawing on blink-off frames during invulnerability.
7. **HUD** (§9) on top.

**Wrap rendering:** for any body whose circle crosses an edge, draw it again offset by
`±W` / `±H` so the straddling portion shows on the opposite side (up to 4 duplicate
draws near a corner).

**Camera:** none (fixed full-field view). **Redraw strategy:** full-frame clear-and-draw
every tick (immediate mode); no dirty-rect optimization needed at these entity counts.
**Fonts:** a monospace/vector-style font (e.g. "Hyperspace"/fallback monospace) for HUD,
24 px score, 18 px secondary.

## 9. UI / HUD / Screens
- **Title screen:** centered game name (64 px), "PRESS ENTER TO START" (24 px), high
  score line, a few slow-drifting background asteroids for ambiance.
- **Playing HUD:**
  - **Score:** top-left at `(24, 16)`, left-aligned, e.g. `04250`.
  - **High score:** top-center, smaller.
  - **Lives:** top-left under score at `(24, 48)`, drawn as N small ship-triangle icons.
  - **Wave:** top-right at `(W-24, 16)`, right-aligned, `WAVE 3`.
- **Pause overlay:** dim the field (50% black overlay) + centered `PAUSED`.
- **Game Over screen:** centered `GAME OVER` (48 px), final score, high score,
  `PRESS ENTER TO RESTART`.

## 10. Audio
Checklist (optional in v1; classic Asteroids feel):

| Event | Sound |
|-------|-------|
| Fire bullet | short "pew" |
| Asteroid destroyed (Large/Med/Small) | three explosion pitches (low→high) |
| Ship thrust | looping low rumble while held |
| Ship destroyed | big explosion |
| UFO present | looping warble (Large = low, Small = high) |
| UFO destroyed | explosion |
| Extra life | chime |
| Background "heartbeat" | two-note beat that speeds up as a wave is cleared down |

## 11. Win / Loss / Scoring
- **Scoring:** Large asteroid 20, Medium 50, Small 100; Large UFO 200, Small UFO 1000.
  Only the **player's** bullets (and ship ramming, which gives no points) score.
- **Extra life:** +1 life at every 10,000 points (`NextExtraLifeAt` advances by 10,000).
- **Loss condition:** lives reach 0 → Game Over.
- **Win condition:** none — it is an endless score chase. "Success" = beating the high
  score. High score persists locally (§13).
- **Lives:** start with 3. No continues.

## 12. Difficulty & Balancing
Data-driven tunables (defaults chosen above):

| Name | Default | Range | Effect |
|------|---------|-------|--------|
| `shipThrustAccel` | 220 px/s² | 120–400 | Acceleration responsiveness |
| `shipRotRate` | 270 deg/s | 150–400 | Turn speed |
| `dragPerTick` | 0.99 | 0.97–0.999 | Glide length (lower = more drag) |
| `shipMaxSpeed` | 600 px/s | 400–900 | Top speed cap |
| `bulletSpeed` | 700 px/s | 500–1000 | Shot velocity |
| `bulletLifetime` | 1.1 s | 0.6–2.0 | Effective range |
| `fireCooldown` | 250 ms | 100–500 | Rate of fire |
| `maxBullets` | 4 | 2–8 | On-screen shot cap |
| `startLives` | 3 | 1–5 | Difficulty floor |
| `waveStartLarge` | 4 | 2–8 | Wave 1 rock count |
| `astSpeedScalePerWave` | 0.06 | 0–0.15 | Per-wave rock speed ramp |
| `hyperBadWarpChance` | 0.12 | 0–0.3 | Hyperspace death risk |
| `ufoSpawnDelay` | 30 s | 5–60 | First UFO appearance |
| `ufoFireInterval` | 1.2 s | 0.5–3.0 | UFO aggression |
| `invulnDuration` | 2.5 s | 0–4 | Respawn grace period |
| `extraLifeEvery` | 10000 | 5000–25000 | Extra-life cadence |

## 13. Technical Notes
- **Timestep:** fixed `dt = 1/60 s` simulation. The render loop accumulates real frame
  time and steps the simulation in whole `1/60` increments (accumulator pattern),
  capping at e.g. 5 steps/frame to avoid a "spiral of death" if the tab stalls.
- **Determinism:** all randomness flows through `Model.Rng` (`System.Random`) seeded at
  `StartGame`; given the same seed + same input sequence the run is reproducible — useful
  for tests.
- **Performance budget:** worst-case entity count is bounded — max ~11 Large →
  effectively ≤ ~44 small fragments + 4 player bullets + 1 UFO + 1 UFO bullet + ≤200
  particles. Far under any 16.7 ms/frame concern; collision is naive O(n²) circle checks
  (a few thousand comparisons max), no spatial partitioning needed.
- **Persistence:** high score saved to local storage / a small `highscore.json`; loaded
  on Title.
- **Edge cases:** (a) firing while 4 bullets alive → no-op; (b) respawn blocked until
  center clear (could stall — center-clear check prevents instant re-death); (c)
  hyperspace landing on a rock → covered by 0.3 s arrival grace except the 12% bad-warp
  roll; (d) an asteroid and the ship spawning overlapped is prevented by the 150 px
  no-spawn radius; (e) wrap-aware distance must be used in collisions or edge-straddling
  bodies miss hits.

## 14. Acceptance Criteria (test scenarios)
Verifiable Given/When/Then. `dt` steps are `1/60 s` unless noted.

1. **Thrust accelerates along heading.**
   Given a stationary ship at heading 0 (pointing +x) at `(640, 360)`,
   When Thrust is held for 60 ticks (1.0 s),
   Then `Vel.X` is positive and `≈ 220 * 1.0` reduced by cumulative drag (within ±15%),
   `Vel.Y ≈ 0`, and the ship has moved right (`Pos.X > 640`).

2. **Drag decays velocity, never reverses it.**
   Given a ship moving at `(300, 0)` px/s with no input,
   When 120 ticks elapse,
   Then `0 < Vel.X < 300` (monotonically decreasing) and `Vel.Y = 0`.

3. **Max speed clamp.**
   Given thrust held continuously for 10 s,
   Then `|Vel|` never exceeds 600 px/s on any tick.

4. **Rotation rate.**
   Given heading 0, When Rotate-right held for 1.0 s,
   Then heading increased by `≈ 270°` (4.712 rad) within ±2°.

5. **Screen wrap (position).**
   Given the ship at `(1279, 360)` with `Vel = (120, 0)`,
   When 1 tick elapses,
   Then `Pos.X` is `≈ 1` (wrapped), not `≈ 1281`.

6. **Bullet inherits momentum and expires.**
   Given a ship at heading 0 with `Vel = (100, 0)` that fires,
   Then a Player bullet exists with `Vel.X ≈ 800` (700 + 100); And after 1.1 s
   (66 ticks) that bullet no longer exists.

7. **Fire cooldown & cap.**
   Given Fire pressed twice within 250 ms, Then only 1 bullet spawns; And given 4
   bullets already alive, pressing Fire spawns none.

8. **Large asteroid split.**
   Given one Large asteroid and a Player bullet overlapping it,
   When collision resolves,
   Then the Large is removed, exactly 2 Medium asteroids exist at its former position,
   and Score increased by 20.

9. **Full split chain & points.**
   Given a Large asteroid fully destroyed (Large → 2 Med → 4 Small → 0),
   When all fragments are shot,
   Then total Score from that lineage = `20 + 2*50 + 4*100 = 520`.

10. **Small asteroid does not split.**
    Given a Small asteroid hit by a bullet,
    Then it is removed, no children spawn, and Score += 100.

11. **Ship death and life loss.**
    Given a non-invulnerable ship overlapping an asteroid,
    When collision resolves,
    Then Lives decreases by 1, ship enters respawn state, and an explosion is emitted.

12. **Respawn invulnerability.**
    Given the ship respawns at center,
    When an asteroid overlaps it within 2.5 s of respawn,
    Then the ship is NOT destroyed (invulnerable) and renders blinking.

13. **Wave progression.**
    Given Wave 1 with all asteroids and any UFO cleared,
    When the 2.0 s inter-wave timer elapses,
    Then Wave becomes 2 and 5 Large asteroids spawn.

14. **Game over.**
    Given Lives = 1 and the ship is destroyed,
    Then Phase becomes GameOver and final Score is shown; And pressing Enter sets
    Phase = Playing with Lives = 3, Score = 0, Wave = 1.

15. **Extra life.**
    Given Score crosses 10,000 (e.g. 9,950 → 10,050),
    Then Lives increases by 1 exactly once and `NextExtraLifeAt` becomes 20,000.

16. **Hyperspace teleport.**
    Given the ship at `(200, 200)`, When Hyperspace is pressed,
    Then `Vel = (0,0)` and `Pos` differs from `(200, 200)`; And with `hyperBadWarpChance`
    forced to 0 the ship survives, with it forced to 1 the ship is destroyed.

17. **UFO scoring.**
    Given a Small UFO hit by a Player bullet, Then it is removed and Score += 1000;
    Given a Large UFO hit, Score += 200.

18. **UFO bullet kills ship; ignores rocks.**
    Given a UFO bullet overlapping a non-invulnerable ship, Then the ship is destroyed;
    Given a UFO bullet overlapping an asteroid, Then both persist unchanged.

19. **Input edge-trigger (no auto-fire).**
    Given Fire held down for 60 ticks without release,
    Then bullets spawn only on the key-down edge and subsequently no faster than the
    250 ms cooldown (i.e. ≤ 4 bullets across that second, not 60).

20. **Determinism.**
    Given two games started with the same RNG seed and the same recorded input sequence,
    Then asteroid spawn positions/velocities and final Score are identical.

## 15. Stretch Goals
1. **Gamepad support** (analog rotate via stick, triggers to fire/thrust).
2. **Mouse aim mode** (rotate ship toward cursor, click to fire).
3. **Powerups** dropped by UFOs: spread-shot, shield, rapid-fire (timed).
4. **Two-player co-op** (second ship, shared wave, separate lives).
5. **Asteroid variety**: rare large "dense" rocks needing 2 hits, or splitting into 3.
6. **CRT/vector post-processing** (glow, scanlines, line bloom) via a Skia shader pass.
7. **Online high-score leaderboard** + replay sharing (leveraging deterministic seeds).
8. **Screen-clear "smart bomb"** as a rare, limited-use panic button.

## Menu & configuration — the shared game shell

Asteroids uses the **generic FS.GG game shell** (FS-GG/FS.GG.Rendering#991) — the same
menu/start screen and settings every FS.GG game shares — rather than a bespoke per-game
menu. Asteroids supplies only its **name**, its **key→command map** (the rebindable actions
from §3 Controls), and its play `update`/`view`; the shell provides everything below.

- **Main menu / start screen** — the game's name (**Asteroids**) as the title label, with
  **Start**, **Config**, and **Exit**. This supersedes the bespoke Title-screen "PRESS ENTER
  TO START" affordance of §9 for launching a run.
- **`Esc` from gameplay** opens the pause menu (Resume · Config · Exit to menu) over the
  same shell; `Esc` again resumes. This is the shell home for the §3 `Esc` / `P` pause action
  and the §9 Pause overlay.
- **Config / Settings**, all applied live and persisted across restarts:
  - **Screen resolution** and **fullscreen** (windowed / borderless / fullscreen), driven
    through the SkiaViewer window-behavior + `LogicalCanvas` letterbox seam — the same seam
    that scales the logical 1280×720 toroidal playfield (§4, §8) to the window.
  - **Key rebinding** — the player remaps Asteroids' controls (the §3 actions: rotate
    left/right, thrust, fire, hyperspace, start/restart, pause) via the `Controls.KeyRebind`
    UI over the `KeyboardInput.Keymap` mechanism; bindings persist via `KeymapCodec` (JSON),
    beside Asteroids' other saved config (e.g. the high score, §13).
  - (Game-specific rows such as difficulty or volume may be added as extra Config rows, but
    the menu, Esc routing, display settings, and rebind screen come from the shell.)

The shell is pointer- and keyboard-navigable over the interactive Controls host (the
`fs-gg-skiaviewer` "game → pointer host" recipe). It is a shared dependency, so Asteroids
does **not** re-specify menu-stack/cursor/settings machinery of its own.

## 16. Milestone Roadmap

Delivery is milestone-sequenced (M0..Mn), each a small, demonstrable slice grounded in the
sections above. Earlier milestones stand up the deterministic simulation core; later ones
layer feel, the shared shell, audio, and the acceptance harness.

### M0 — Scaffold & fixed-step loop
Stand up the Elmish/MVU app (§7) on the FS.GG.Rendering host: the `Model`/`Msg` skeleton,
the 60 FPS `Tick (1/60)` subscription with the accumulator pattern capped at ~5 steps/frame
(§7, §13), and an empty 1280×720 logical canvas (§4, §8) that clears to black every frame.
No gameplay yet — just a deterministic, steppable loop with `Phase = Title`.

### M1 — Ship movement & toroidal wrap
Implement the ship (§4.1, §5.1): 270 deg/s held rotation, 220 px/s² thrust along the nose
vector, per-tick drag (`vel *= 0.99`), the 600 px/s max-speed clamp, and position
integration. Add the toroidal screen wrap (§4.6) with per-axis wrap and the wrap-aware
shortest-delta distance used later for all collisions. No firing or rocks yet — just a
ship that drifts around a wrapping field.

### M2 — Firing & bullets
Add bullets (§4.2, §5.3): muzzle velocity `vel + noseVec·700` (momentum-inherited, not
speed-clamped), the nose-tip spawn point, 250 ms fire cooldown, the 4-concurrent-bullet
cap, 1.1 s lifetime despawn, and bullet wrapping. Fire is edge-triggered off `KeyDown`
(§3) with no auto-repeat.

### M3 — Asteroids: splitting & waves
Build the three-size asteroid class (§4.3, §5.2) with per-size radius/speed/points, the
2-children-on-death split with `±[15°,45°]` velocity offsets and fresh speed magnitudes,
cosmetic spin, and the wave spawner (§6): `min(4+(n−1), 11)` Large rocks per wave at edge
positions ≥150 px from spawn center, the wave-clear check, the 2.0 s inter-wave pause, and
the per-wave speed ramp.

### M4 — Collisions, death, respawn & invulnerability
Wire circle-vs-circle collision (§4.4) over the wrap-aware distance: bullet↔asteroid (split
+ score), ship↔asteroid (death). Add the death/respawn cycle (§4.5): decrement lives,
explosion particles, 1.5 s freeze, center-clear respawn gating, 2.5 s blinking spawn
invulnerability, and `Lives = 0 → GameOver`. Scoring (§11) and the every-10,000 extra life.

### M5 — Hyperspace
Add the hyperspace escape (§4.7): teleport to a uniformly random position with zeroed
velocity, 1.0 s cooldown, the 12% bad-warp death roll resolved after placement, and the
0.3 s arrival invulnerability so a landed-on rock doesn't insta-kill except via the roll.
Edge-triggered off `KeyDown`.

### M6 — UFO enemy
Implement the flying saucer (§4.8, §5.4): Large/Small types with score-scaled Small
probability, edge-entry horizontal travel with the 1.0 s vertical jog zig-zag, 1.2 s
firing with UFO bullets (350 px/s, 1.4 s), the spawn schedule (30 s or ≤3 rocks, ≤1 at a
time), and the remaining collision cases (bullet↔UFO, ship↔UFO/UFO-bullet, UFO-bullet
passes through rocks).

### M7 — Rendering, HUD & vector look
Complete the back-to-front vector draw list (§8): black clear, fading particle lines,
white asteroid polygons rotated by `Angle`, red saucer outline, player/UFO bullet dots,
the `#00FFAA` ship triangle with `#FFAA00` exhaust and invulnerability blink, plus the
edge-duplicate wrap rendering. Render the HUD (score, high score, ship-icon lives, wave)
and the §9 Title / Pause / Game Over screens.

### M8 — Menus, settings & key rebinding (shared game shell)
Adopt the generic game shell (FS-GG/FS.GG.Rendering#991): main menu (title **Asteroids** +
Start/Config/Exit), `Esc` pause routing (Resume · Config · Exit to menu), Settings with
screen resolution + fullscreen through the SkiaViewer + `LogicalCanvas` letterbox seam, and
in-game key rebinding of the §3 controls (rotate, thrust, fire, hyperspace, start, pause),
persisted via `KeymapCodec`. Asteroids provides its name + key→command map + play
`update`/`view`; the shell provides the rest. No bespoke menu system — this replaces the
ad-hoc Title/Pause affordances of §9.

### M9 — Audio
Wire the SFX checklist (§10): the fire "pew", three-pitch asteroid explosions, the looping
thrust rumble, the ship-destroyed explosion, the per-size UFO warble loop and its
destruction, the extra-life chime, and the two-note background "heartbeat" that speeds up
as a wave is cleared down. A shell Config volume row may drive levels.

### M10 — Acceptance & determinism
Land the acceptance harness against all 20 scenarios (§14): thrust/drag/max-speed, rotation
rate, position wrap, bullet momentum/expiry, fire cooldown & cap, the full split chain and
points, ship death and respawn invulnerability, wave progression, game over/restart, extra
life, hyperspace survival/death rolls, UFO scoring and bullet behavior, edge-trigger no
auto-fire, and the seed + input-sequence **determinism** replay yielding identical spawns
and final Score (§13).
