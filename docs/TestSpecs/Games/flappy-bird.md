# Flappy Bird

## 1. Overview
You are a tubby bird that cannot stop falling. One button — a flap — gives you a single
upward beat of the wings, and gravity immediately starts dragging you back down. The
world scrolls left at a constant clip, hurling an endless procession of green pipes at
you, each with a narrow gap punched somewhere in it. The fantasy is pure twitch mastery:
threading a too-small gap, again and again, on nothing but timing and nerve. It is fun
because the control is brutally simple, the failure is instant and unambiguous, and the
score is a public dare — "one more try" is the whole game.

## 2. Core Game Loop
**Moment-to-moment:** fall → judge the next gap → flap to gain altitude → glide down →
pass the pipe (score) → judge the next gap → repeat. The player is constantly trading
altitude against the approaching gap, tapping just enough to stay alive.

**Session-level:** title/ready screen → tap to start → play (flap through pipes,
accumulate score) → collide (with pipe or ground) → instant death → game-over screen
showing score + best → tap to restart from the ready screen. A full session is dozens of
2-to-60-second runs.

## 3. Controls & Input
The game is single-button. The same action ("Flap") starts a run, flaps during play, and
(after a short lockout) restarts from game-over.

| Input | Device | Action | Model |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| `Space` | Keyboard | Flap / Start / Restart | Edge-triggered (key-down only; holding does NOT auto-repeat) |
| `↑` (Up arrow) | Keyboard | Flap (alias) | Edge-triggered |
| Left mouse click | Mouse | Flap / Start / Restart | Edge-triggered (button-down) |
| `Esc` | Keyboard | Pause / resume | Edge-triggered |

Input model notes:
- **Flap is edge-triggered.** Each physical key-down or click yields exactly one flap
  impulse. Auto-repeat from a held key MUST be ignored (track key-held state; only the
  press transition counts).
- A flap is accepted at any time during `Playing`, including when the bird is already
  rising (it overrides current vertical velocity — see 4.2).
- On the game-over screen, input is ignored for `restartLockoutMs` (default 600 ms) to
  prevent an accidental instant restart from the killing tap.

## 4. Mechanics (detailed)

All physics use a **logical pixel coordinate system** with **+Y pointing DOWN** (screen
convention). Positions/velocities are in logical px and px/s. The simulation runs on a
**fixed 60 Hz timestep** (`dt = 1/60 s ≈ 0.01667 s`); see §13.

### 4.1 Gravity & Falling
- Constant downward acceleration: **`gravity = 2400 px/s²`**.
- Applied every tick to the bird's vertical velocity: `vy ← vy + gravity * dt`.
- **Terminal velocity (downward):** `vyMax = +900 px/s`. After applying gravity, clamp
  `vy = min(vy, vyMax)`.

### 4.2 Flap Impulse
- A flap **sets** (does not add to) vertical velocity to a fixed upward value:
  **`vy ← flapImpulse = -620 px/s`** (negative = up).
- Because it overrides `vy`, rapid flaps do not stack into ever-higher jumps; each flap is
  one identical beat.
- There is no upward velocity cap beyond the impulse itself (the bird can never exceed
  `|flapImpulse|` upward, since flap sets and gravity only reduces upward speed).
- Optional ceiling rule: the bird may rise above the top of the screen (`y < 0`) but is
  **clamped** so its top never goes above `y = -birdHeight` — it cannot fly off-screen
  upward to dodge pipes. Hitting the ceiling clamps `y` and sets `vy = max(vy, 0)`.

### 4.3 Horizontal Scroll
- The bird's X position is **fixed** at `birdX = 320` (logical px from the left). The bird
  never moves horizontally.
- The world scrolls toward the bird: all pipes move left at **`scrollSpeed = 180 px/s`**
  (`pipe.x ← pipe.x - scrollSpeed * dt`). This is the effective forward speed of the bird.
- `scrollSpeed` is constant in v1 (no speed ramp — see §12 for the optional ramp tunable).

### 4.4 Pipe Spawning
- Pipes spawn as **pairs** (a top pipe and a bottom pipe sharing one gap).
- **Horizontal spacing:** a new pipe pair is created so that consecutive gaps are
  **`pipeSpacing = 360 px`** apart (measured center-to-center on X). Equivalently, spawn a
  new pair when the most-recent pair has moved `pipeSpacing` px from the spawn line.
- **Spawn line:** new pairs are created with `x = playfieldWidth + pipeWidth` (just off the
  right edge), i.e. `x = 1280 + 80 = 1360`.
- **Despawn:** a pair is removed once fully off the left edge (`x + pipeWidth < 0`).
- **Pipe width:** `pipeWidth = 80 px`.

### 4.5 Gap Size & Vertical Randomization
- **Gap height (vertical opening):** `gapHeight = 200 px` in v1 (tunable; see §12).
- The gap's vertical center `gapCenterY` is randomized per pair within a safe band so the
  gap never clips the ground or the top:
  - `gapMargin = 80 px` (minimum distance from gap edge to screen top and to the ground).
  - Let `groundY = 640` (top of the ground strip; see 4.7).
  - `gapCenterY ∈ [gapMargin + gapHeight/2, groundY - gapMargin - gapHeight/2]`
    = `[80 + 100, 640 - 80 - 100]` = **`[180, 460]`**.
  - Draw `gapCenterY = rng.NextFloat(180, 460)` (inclusive range).
- Derived geometry for a pair at horizontal position `x`:
  - **Top pipe:** rect `{ x; y = 0; w = 80; h = gapCenterY - gapHeight/2 }`.
  - **Bottom pipe:** rect `{ x; y = gapCenterY + gapHeight/2; w = 80; h = groundY - (gapCenterY + gapHeight/2) }`.

### 4.6 Scoring on Pass
- Each pipe pair has a `scored: bool` flag, initially `false`.
- When the **pipe pair's right edge** passes the **bird's X** (`pipe.x + pipeWidth < birdX`)
  and `scored = false`, increment `score` by **1** and set `scored = true`.
- Score is awarded for surviving the gap, not for touching it; passing the X line without a
  collision is sufficient.

### 4.7 Collision & Ground
- **Bird collision box (AABB):** centered on the bird, `birdWidth = 34 px` ×
  `birdHeight = 24 px`. To make near-misses feel fair, the collision box is **inset** by
  `collisionInset = 2 px` on every side relative to the drawn sprite (effective box
  ~30×20). All collision uses this inset AABB.
- **Pipe collision:** AABB-vs-AABB test of the bird box against each pipe rect (top and
  bottom) of every on-screen pair. Any overlap = collision.
- **Ground:** a solid ground strip occupies `y ∈ [groundY, playfieldHeight]` =
  `[640, 720]`. If `bird.box.bottom ≥ groundY`, that is a ground collision.
- **Ceiling:** not lethal — the bird is clamped (see 4.2).
- **Instant-death model:** ANY collision (pipe or ground) ends the run immediately. There
  is no health, no invulnerability frames, no knockback. On death: freeze scrolling,
  transition to `GameOver`, the bird falls under gravity to rest on the ground (cosmetic),
  and the death SFX/score panel show.

## 5. Entities / Game Objects

### Bird (exactly one)
- **Size (sprite):** 34×24 px. **Collision box:** inset AABB (~30×20), see 4.7.
- **Properties:** `x = 320` (fixed), `y` (float), `vy` (float), `rotationDeg` (cosmetic).
- **Behavior:** integrates gravity each tick; flap sets `vy`. Rotation is derived from
  velocity for flavor: `rotationDeg = clamp(vy * 0.06, -25, +90)` (nose-up when rising,
  nose-down when diving).
- **Created:** once, at run start, at `y = playfieldHeight/2 = 360`, `vy = 0`.
- **Destroyed:** never pooled away; reset on restart.

### PipePair (0..N, typically 4–5 on screen)
- **Properties:** `x` (float, left edge), `gapCenterY` (float), `scored` (bool).
- **Size:** width 80; top/bottom rects derived from `gapCenterY` and `gapHeight` (see 4.5).
- **Behavior:** moves left at `scrollSpeed`; flags `scored` when passed.
- **Created:** by the spawner every `pipeSpacing` px of scroll, off the right edge.
- **Destroyed:** when `x + pipeWidth < 0`.

### Ground (visual + collision)
- A static strip `y ∈ [640, 720]`. Texture/pattern scrolls left at `scrollSpeed` for
  parallax but its collision top stays at `groundY = 640`.

F# type sketch:
```fsharp
type Bird =
    { Y: float
      Vy: float
      RotationDeg: float }   // X is the constant birdX = 320.0

type PipePair =
    { X: float               // left edge, moves left over time
      GapCenterY: float
      Scored: bool }
```

## 6. World / Levels / Progression
- **Playfield:** `1280 × 720` logical px. Origin top-left, +Y down. The view scales this
  logical canvas to the physical window (letterboxed) so physics stays resolution-independent.
- **No discrete levels.** The game is a single endless run; "progression" is the rising
  score and the player's own improving skill.
- **Difficulty ramp (v1 = flat):** all constants (`scrollSpeed`, `gapHeight`, `pipeSpacing`)
  are constant for the whole run. The optional ramp (see §12) tightens the gap and/or
  speeds scroll as score climbs; it is OFF by default to match the classic feel.
- **What changes over time:** only the randomized `gapCenterY` per pair, the parallax
  scroll of background/ground, and the score.

## 7. State Model (Elmish/MVU)

### Model
```fsharp
type Phase =
    | Ready                  // waiting for first flap
    | Playing
    | GameOver of finalScore: int

type Model =
    { Phase: Phase
      Bird: Bird
      Pipes: PipePair list
      Score: int
      Best: int                       // persisted high score
      DistanceSinceSpawn: float       // px scrolled since last spawn, drives spawner
      Rng: System.Random              // seeded RNG for gap placement (determinism)
      GameOverElapsedMs: float        // for the restart lockout
      Paused: bool }
```

### Msg
```fsharp
type Msg =
    | Flap                  // edge-triggered: start / flap / restart (post-lockout)
    | TogglePause
    | Tick of dt: float     // seconds, fixed ~0.01667
```

### update — key cases
- **`Flap` while `Ready`:** transition to `Playing`, apply one flap impulse
  (`vy = flapImpulse`), reset score, clear pipes, reseed/keep RNG.
- **`Flap` while `Playing`:** set `bird.vy = flapImpulse` (override). Play flap SFX.
- **`Flap` while `GameOver`:** if `GameOverElapsedMs ≥ restartLockoutMs`, reset to a fresh
  `Ready` model (preserving `Best` and `Rng`); otherwise ignore.
- **`TogglePause`:** flip `Paused`; while paused, `Tick` is a no-op for physics.
- **`Tick dt` while `Playing` and not paused (in order):**
  1. Integrate bird: `vy = min(vy + gravity*dt, vyMax)`; `y += vy*dt`; clamp ceiling.
  2. Scroll pipes: `x -= scrollSpeed*dt`; advance `DistanceSinceSpawn += scrollSpeed*dt`.
  3. Spawn: while `DistanceSinceSpawn ≥ pipeSpacing`, emit a new pair (random `gapCenterY`
     from `Rng`), subtract `pipeSpacing`.
  4. Despawn pairs with `x + pipeWidth < 0`.
  5. Scoring: for each unpassed pair with `x + pipeWidth < birdX`, `score += 1; scored = true`.
  6. Collision: if bird AABB overlaps any pipe rect, or `bird.box.bottom ≥ groundY`,
     transition to `GameOver finalScore=score` and update `Best`.
- **`Tick dt` while `GameOver`:** advance `GameOverElapsedMs`; let bird keep falling to
  ground (cosmetic), do not scroll pipes.
- **`Tick dt` while `Ready`:** bird bobs gently (cosmetic sine hover), no gravity death.

### view
Pure function `Model -> Scene`. It reads phase + entities and emits draw commands
(background, pipes, ground, bird, HUD, overlays). It performs **no mutation** and no
physics; Skia draws the returned scene. Phase selects which overlay (ready prompt vs.
game-over panel) is added.

### Subscriptions
- **Tick:** a 60 FPS timer subscription dispatching `Tick (1.0/60.0)`. Implementation uses
  a fixed-timestep accumulator (see §13) so logic is frame-rate independent.
- **Input:** keyboard key-down (`Space`, `↑`, `Esc`) and mouse button-down events mapped to
  `Flap` / `TogglePause`, with key-held de-bounce so only press edges dispatch.

## 8. Rendering (Skia 2D)
Coordinate system matches physics (top-left origin, +Y down), logical 1280×720 scaled to
the window. Redraw the full canvas each frame (cheap at this entity count); no dirty-rect
optimization needed.

**Draw order (back to front):**
1. **Sky background** — solid fill `#4EC0CA` (classic cyan). Optional parallax cloud layer
   scrolling left at `0.3 * scrollSpeed`.
2. **Pipes** — for each pair, draw top + bottom rects. Body fill `#73BF2E`, 2 px darker
   outline `#558022`, and a "lip" cap rect (`88 px` wide, `26 px` tall, centered on
   `pipeWidth`) at each gap-facing end for the classic mushroom look.
3. **Ground strip** — `y ∈ [640, 720]`, fill `#DED895` with a `#73BF2E` top edge band
   (8 px). Texture offset scrolls left at `scrollSpeed`, wrapping every 48 px.
4. **Bird** — 34×24 sprite/rounded-rect, body `#F7D51D`, drawn rotated by `bird.rotationDeg`
   about its center. Simple 2-frame wing flap toggling on each `Flap`.
5. **HUD** — score text, top-center (see §9).
6. **Overlays** — ready prompt or game-over panel (see §9), drawn last.

**Fonts:** a single bold sans (e.g. bundled "Press Start 2P"-style or system bold). Score
uses a large outlined style: white fill `#FFFFFF` with a 3 px black `#000000` outline.

**Visual effects (optional, cheap):** a brief white flash (1 frame, `#FFFFFF` at 50% alpha
fading over 150 ms) on collision; small feather/dust particles on flap (≤ 6 particles).

## 9. UI / HUD / Screens

**Screens:**
- **Ready:** title "Flappy Bird" centered-upper; the bird bobbing at center; prompt
  "Tap / Space to flap" with a tap icon. Best score shown small, top-right.
- **Playing:** only the in-world HUD (live score).
- **Paused:** dim the playfield to 40% and show "PAUSED — Esc to resume" centered.
- **Game Over:** a centered panel (`~420×260 px`) with header "Game Over", the run score,
  the medal (optional), the best score, and "Tap to play again" (greyed until lockout ends).

**HUD elements:**
- **Live score:** top-center at `(640, 80)`, large outlined digits, integer, updates on pass.
- **Best score:** small, top-right `(1180, 24)`, format `BEST 000` (right-aligned).
- All text horizontally centered on its anchor unless noted.

## 10. Audio
Audio is optional in v1 (a silent build must still pass acceptance).

| Event | SFX |
|-------|-----|
| Flap | short "wing" whoosh |
| Pass pipe / score | bright "point" blip |
| Collision (pipe) | "hit" thud |
| Ground impact | "die" splat (after hit) |
| New best on game-over | "fanfare" sting |

Music: none during play (classic). Optional low ambient on title screen.

## 11. Win / Loss / Scoring
- **Scoring:** +1 per pipe pair passed (see 4.6). No multipliers, no time bonus, no combo.
- **Win condition:** none — the game is endless. "Winning" is beating your `Best`.
- **Loss condition:** any collision (pipe or ground) ends the run instantly (see 4.7).
- **Lives / continues:** none. One life per run; death → game-over → manual restart.
- **Best:** `Best = max(Best, finalScore)`, persisted across runs (see §13).

## 12. Difficulty & Balancing
Data-driven tunables (defaults match classic feel). The optional `*Ramp` values are OFF
by default.

| Name | Default | Range | Effect |
|------|---------|-------|--------|
| `gravity` | 2400 px/s² | 1500–3200 | Fall acceleration; higher = heavier, harder |
| `flapImpulse` | -620 px/s | -500..-760 | Upward beat strength (set, not added) |
| `vyMax` | 900 px/s | 600–1200 | Terminal fall speed |
| `scrollSpeed` | 180 px/s | 120–300 | World/forward speed; higher = less reaction time |
| `pipeSpacing` | 360 px | 260–480 | Horizontal distance between gaps |
| `gapHeight` | 200 px | 130–260 | Vertical opening; smaller = harder |
| `gapMargin` | 80 px | 40–140 | Keeps gaps off the top/ground |
| `pipeWidth` | 80 px | 60–100 | Pipe thickness |
| `birdX` | 320 px | 200–480 | Bird's fixed screen column |
| `collisionInset` | 2 px | 0–6 | Forgiveness on the bird hitbox |
| `restartLockoutMs` | 600 ms | 0–1200 | Anti-misclick delay on game-over |
| `gapHeightRamp` | 0 (off) | 0–0.5 px/pt | Optional: shrink gap by N px per point scored (floor 130) |
| `scrollSpeedRamp` | 0 (off) | 0–2 px/s/pt | Optional: speed up scroll per point (cap 300) |

## 13. Technical Notes
- **Performance budget:** trivial — 1 bird + ~5 pipe pairs + ground + HUD ≈ < 20 draw
  calls/frame. Target 60 FPS / 16.7 ms frame with vast headroom.
- **Fixed vs. variable timestep:** **fixed** 60 Hz logic. The tick subscription uses an
  accumulator: accumulate real elapsed time, step `update (Tick (1/60))` while
  `accumulator ≥ 1/60`, subtract each step. This makes physics deterministic and
  frame-rate independent; rendering interpolation is optional and not required for v1.
- **Determinism / RNG:** `gapCenterY` is the only randomness. Use a single seeded
  `System.Random` stored in the model. A fixed seed + a fixed sequence of `Flap` ticks
  yields an identical pipe layout — this is what acceptance tests rely on.
- **Persistence:** `Best` is saved to local storage / a small JSON file (`flappy.best`) and
  loaded on boot. If absent, `Best = 0`.
- **Edge cases:** flap on the exact death frame still dies; multiple pipes can be passed in
  a single tick at high `scrollSpeed` (loop all unpassed pairs, not just the front one);
  if the window loses focus, auto-`TogglePause`; resizing only rescales the logical canvas,
  never the physics constants; a gap must always satisfy `gapHeight + 2*gapMargin ≤ groundY`
  (200 + 160 = 360 ≤ 640 ✓) or spawning asserts.

## 14. Acceptance Criteria (test scenarios)

1. **Gravity pulls the bird down.**
   GIVEN a `Playing` model with `bird.y = 360`, `bird.vy = 0`
   WHEN one `Tick(1/60)` is applied with no `Flap`
   THEN `bird.vy ≈ 40` px/s (`2400 * 1/60`) and `bird.y > 360` (moved downward).

2. **Terminal velocity is clamped.**
   GIVEN a `Playing` model with `bird.vy = 880`
   WHEN one `Tick(1/60)` is applied (no flap)
   THEN `bird.vy = 900` (clamped to `vyMax`), not 920.

3. **Flap sets a fixed upward velocity (override, not additive).**
   GIVEN a `Playing` model with `bird.vy = 300` (falling)
   WHEN `Flap` is dispatched
   THEN `bird.vy = -620` exactly; AND dispatching `Flap` again immediately also yields
   `bird.vy = -620` (no stacking).

4. **Held key does not auto-flap.**
   GIVEN `Space` is pressed and held down across 30 ticks
   WHEN no new key-down edge occurs
   THEN exactly one flap impulse was applied (only on the initial press edge).

5. **Score increments when a pipe pair passes the bird.**
   GIVEN a pipe pair at `x` such that `x + pipeWidth = birdX + 1` and `scored = false`, score = 4
   WHEN ticks advance until `x + pipeWidth < birdX`
   THEN `score = 5` and that pair's `scored = true`; AND further ticks do not increment
   again for the same pair.

6. **Multiple pipes can score in one tick.**
   GIVEN two unpassed pairs both with `x + pipeWidth` just past `birdX` after a large `dt`
   WHEN one `Tick` is applied
   THEN `score` increases by 2 (the scorer loops all unpassed passed pairs).

7. **Collision with a pipe is instant death.**
   GIVEN a `Playing` model where the bird AABB overlaps a top pipe rect
   WHEN one `Tick` is applied
   THEN `Phase = GameOver finalScore=score` and scrolling stops on subsequent ticks.

8. **Ground collision is instant death.**
   GIVEN `bird.y` such that `bird.box.bottom ≥ 640` (groundY)
   WHEN one `Tick` is applied
   THEN `Phase = GameOver` (regardless of pipe positions).

9. **Ceiling is clamped, not lethal.**
   GIVEN repeated `Flap`s drive the bird to `y ≤ -birdHeight`
   WHEN ticks continue
   THEN `bird.y` is clamped to `-birdHeight`, `vy ≥ 0`, and `Phase` stays `Playing`.

10. **Pipe spawning cadence.**
    GIVEN a fresh `Playing` run with empty pipes and `scrollSpeed = 180`
    WHEN the world scrolls `pipeSpacing = 360` px (i.e. 2.0 s of ticks)
    THEN exactly one new pair has spawned per 360 px of scroll, each at `x = 1360`.

11. **Gap randomization stays in the safe band.**
    GIVEN any spawned pair across 1000 seeded spawns
    WHEN `gapCenterY` is sampled
    THEN `180 ≤ gapCenterY ≤ 460` for every pair (gap never clips top or ground).

12. **Deterministic layout from a seed.**
    GIVEN two runs with the same RNG seed and the identical sequence of `Flap`/`Tick`
    WHEN both run for 30 s
    THEN the two pipe layouts (`x`, `gapCenterY` sequences) are identical and scores match.

13. **Restart lockout on game-over.**
    GIVEN `Phase = GameOver` with `GameOverElapsedMs = 200` (< 600)
    WHEN `Flap` is dispatched
    THEN the model stays `GameOver` (input ignored); AND once `GameOverElapsedMs ≥ 600`,
    a `Flap` resets to a fresh `Ready` model preserving `Best`.

14. **Best score persists and updates.**
    GIVEN `Best = 7` and a run that ends with `finalScore = 12`
    WHEN entering `GameOver`
    THEN `Best = 12`; AND a subsequent run ending at `finalScore = 5` leaves `Best = 12`.

15. **Pause freezes physics.**
    GIVEN a `Playing` model
    WHEN `TogglePause` then several `Tick`s are applied
    THEN `bird.y`, `bird.vy`, and pipe `x` are unchanged until `TogglePause` resumes.

## 15. Stretch Goals
1. **Medals** (bronze/silver/gold/platinum at score thresholds 10/20/30/40) on game-over.
2. **Difficulty ramp** — enable `gapHeightRamp`/`scrollSpeedRamp` for an escalating mode.
3. **Day/night theme swap** every N points (palette change for sky/pipes).
4. **Ghost replay** of your best run (deterministic RNG makes this nearly free).
5. **Daily seed challenge** — fixed seed of the day, leaderboard by score.
6. **Alternate birds / skins** (cosmetic palette swaps).
7. **Gamepad + touch** input parity for handheld/mobile builds.

## Menu & configuration — the shared game shell

Flappy Bird uses the **generic FS.GG game shell** (FS-GG/FS.GG.Rendering#991) — the same
menu/start screen and settings every FS.GG game shares — rather than a bespoke per-game
menu. Flappy Bird supplies only its **name**, its **key→command map** (the rebindable
actions from §3 Controls), and its play `update`/`view`; the shell provides everything below.

- **Main menu / start screen** — the game's name (**Flappy Bird**) as the title label, with
  **Start**, **Config**, and **Exit**. This supersedes the bespoke Ready-screen "Tap / Space
  to flap" launch affordance of §9 for beginning a run (the first in-run flap that starts a
  round is unchanged; the shell owns the pre-run entry point).
- **`Esc` from gameplay** opens the pause menu (Resume · Config · Exit to menu) over the
  same shell; `Esc` again resumes. This is the shell home for the §3 `Esc` pause action and
  the §9 Paused screen.
- **Config / Settings**, all applied live and persisted across restarts:
  - **Screen resolution** and **fullscreen** (windowed / borderless / fullscreen), driven
    through the SkiaViewer window-behavior + `LogicalCanvas` letterbox seam — the same seam
    that letterboxes the logical 1280×720 playfield (§6, §8) to the window so physics stays
    resolution-independent.
  - **Key rebinding** — the player remaps Flappy Bird's controls (the §3 actions: flap
    (Space / Up / click) and pause) via the `Controls.KeyRebind` UI over the
    `KeyboardInput.Keymap` mechanism; bindings persist via `KeymapCodec` (JSON), beside
    Flappy Bird's other saved config (e.g. `flappy.best`, §13).
  - (Game-specific rows such as difficulty or volume may be added as extra Config rows, but
    the menu, Esc routing, display settings, and rebind screen come from the shell.)

The shell is pointer- and keyboard-navigable over the interactive Controls host (the
`fs-gg-skiaviewer` "game → pointer host" recipe). It is a shared dependency, so Flappy Bird
does **not** re-specify menu-stack/cursor/settings machinery of its own.

## 16. Milestone Roadmap

Delivery is milestone-sequenced (M0..Mn), each a small, demonstrable slice grounded in the
sections above. Earlier milestones stand up the deterministic simulation core; later ones
layer feel, the shared shell, audio, and the acceptance harness.

### M0 — Scaffold & fixed-step loop
Stand up the Elmish/MVU app (§7) on the FS.GG.Rendering host: the `Model`/`Msg` skeleton,
the fixed 60 Hz `Tick (1/60)` subscription driven by an accumulator (§13), and an empty
1280×720 logical canvas (§6, §8) clearing to the cyan sky each frame. No gameplay yet — just
a deterministic, steppable loop with `Phase = Ready`.

### M1 — Bird gravity & flap impulse
Implement the bird (§4.1, §4.2, §5): constant `gravity = 2400 px/s²` with the `vyMax = 900`
terminal clamp, the edge-triggered flap that **sets** `vy = -620` (override, not additive,
no auto-repeat), and the ceiling clamp at `y = -birdHeight` with `vy = max(vy, 0)`. Derive
the cosmetic velocity-based rotation.

### M2 — Horizontal scroll & pipe spawning
Add the world scroll and pipe pairs (§4.3, §4.4, §4.5, §5): pipes moving left at
`scrollSpeed = 180 px/s`, the `pipeSpacing = 360 px` spawn cadence off the right edge at
`x = 1360`, despawn past the left edge, and the per-pair `gapCenterY` randomized in the safe
band `[180, 460]` from the seeded RNG with derived top/bottom rects. The bird stays fixed at
`birdX = 320`.

### M3 — Scoring on pass
Implement pass-scoring (§4.6): each pair's `scored` flag flips and `score += 1` when its
right edge passes `birdX`, looping **all** unpassed pairs so multiple can score in one tick.
No multipliers or combos.

### M4 — Collision, ground & instant death
Add the inset AABB bird box (§4.7) and AABB-vs-AABB tests against every pipe rect plus the
ground strip at `groundY = 640`. Any overlap is instant death: freeze scrolling, transition
to `GameOver`, and let the bird fall to rest (cosmetic). Ceiling is clamped, not lethal.

### M5 — Phase flow: ready / playing / game-over & restart lockout
Wire the full phase machine (§7.3): `Ready` (gentle bob, first flap starts the run and
resets score/pipes) → `Playing` → `GameOver(finalScore)` with `Best = max(Best, score)`
persisted (§13). Enforce the `restartLockoutMs = 600 ms` input lockout on game-over, and the
`TogglePause` freeze.

### M6 — Rendering & HUD
Complete the back-to-front draw list (§8): cyan sky with optional parallax clouds, green
mushroom-capped pipes, the scrolling ground strip, the rotated flapping bird, the large
outlined top-center score, and optional collision flash / flap dust particles. Render the
§9 Ready / Playing / Paused / Game Over screens with the best-score readout and medal slot.

### M7 — Menus, settings & key rebinding (shared game shell)
Adopt the generic game shell (FS-GG/FS.GG.Rendering#991): main menu (title **Flappy Bird** +
Start/Config/Exit), `Esc` pause routing (Resume · Config · Exit to menu), Settings with
screen resolution + fullscreen through the SkiaViewer + `LogicalCanvas` letterbox seam, and
in-game key rebinding of the §3 controls (flap, pause), persisted via `KeymapCodec`. Flappy
Bird provides its name + key→command map + play `update`/`view`; the shell provides the rest.
No bespoke menu system — this replaces the ad-hoc Ready/Pause affordances of §9.

### M8 — Audio
Wire the SFX table (§10): the flap "wing" whoosh, the bright pass/score blip, the pipe-hit
thud, the ground-impact splat, and the new-best fanfare on game-over, plus the optional
title-screen ambient. A silent build must still pass acceptance; a shell Config volume row
may drive levels.

### M9 — Acceptance & determinism
Land the acceptance harness against all 15 scenarios (§14): gravity, terminal clamp, flap
override no-stacking, held-key no-auto-flap, single- and multi-pipe scoring, pipe and ground
instant death, ceiling clamp, spawn cadence, gap-band bounds over 1000 seeded spawns, the
restart lockout, best-score persistence, pause freeze, and the seed + input-sequence
**determinism** replay yielding identical pipe layouts and scores (§13).
