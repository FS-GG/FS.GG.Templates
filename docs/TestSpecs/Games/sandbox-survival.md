# Hollowreach

## 1. Overview

**Hollowreach** is a 2D side-view sandbox survival/crafting game in the lineage of
Terraria and Starbound. The player wakes on the surface of a procedurally generated,
fully destructible tile world with nothing but their fists. The core verb is **mine →
craft → build → survive**: dig into the earth for stone, ore, and gems; refine raw
resources at crafting stations into better tools, weapons, and walls; and fortify a
shelter before nightfall, when hostile creatures crawl out of the dark to test it. Every
tile in the world can be removed and almost every tile can be placed, so the world is the
player's to reshape. The fun is the compounding loop of capability: a wooden pickaxe gets
you stone, stone tools get you iron, iron gets you deep into the cave layer where the best
ore (and the worst monsters) live. One in-game day is a tractable goal; surviving and
expanding across many days is the long arc.

The fantasy is **self-reliant frontier mastery over a hostile, malleable world**.

## 2. Core Game Loop

**Moment-to-moment loop (seconds):**
`move/jump → aim cursor at a tile → mine (hold) or place (click) → pick up drops →
manage hotbar → react to threats → repeat`

**Tactical loop (minutes):** descend for resources → return to base → craft at stations →
upgrade tools/armor → extend base/lighting → descend deeper.

**Session loop (day cycle, ~14 real minutes per full day at default):**
`dawn (gather/explore) → noon (deep mining) → dusk (retreat & fortify) → night (defend
shelter, fight enemies) → survive to dawn (resources banked, tier advanced) → repeat`

**Session-level (start → end):**
`new world (seed) → spawn on surface → survive N days / reach a tier goal →
death (respawn at bed/spawn with item loss rules) → quit saves world → resume loads world`

There is no hard "win"; the implicit objective is tier progression (see §11) and the
explicit failure state is death without a respawn anchor on permadeath worlds.

## 3. Controls & Input

Keyboard-primary with mouse for aiming/targeting. Input model column notes whether the
action is **edge-triggered** (fires once on the transition) or **level/held** (acts every
tick the key is down).

| Input | Action | Model |
|---|---|---|
| `A` / `D` (or `←`/`→`) | Walk left / right | Held |
| `Space` / `W` | Jump (and double-jump if unlocked) | Edge (press) |
| `S` (held in air) | Fast-fall (increase gravity) | Held |
| `S` (on platform tile) | Drop through one-way platform | Edge |
| Mouse move | Move tile cursor (block highlight) | Continuous |
| Left mouse (hold) | Mine targeted tile / attack toward cursor | Held |
| Right mouse (click) | Place selected tile/item at cursor | Edge |
| Mouse wheel / `1`–`0` | Cycle / select hotbar slot (10 slots) | Edge |
| `E` | Open / close inventory + crafting panel | Edge (toggle) |
| `Q` | Drop one of selected stack to world | Edge |
| Left mouse (in inventory) | Pick up / place stack (split with `Shift`) | Edge |
| `F` | Interact (open chest, use station, sleep in bed) | Edge |
| `Esc` | Pause menu / close panel | Edge |
| `R` | Use/eat selected consumable (food/potion) | Edge |
| `Ctrl` (held) + mine | Mine background **wall** instead of foreground tile | Held modifier |
| `Tab` | Toggle minimap | Edge |

**Reach rule:** placement and mining are only allowed within a **5-tile (160 px) radius**
of the player's center, and the target tile must be adjacent (4-connected) to an existing
tile or the player must have line-of-sight to it (prevents floating placement).

## 4. Mechanics (detailed)

All physics run on a **fixed timestep of 1/60 s (dt = 0.0167 s)**. Distances are in
**pixels (px)**; one tile = **32×32 px**. Velocities are px/s, accelerations px/s².

### 4.1 Movement & platformer physics

- **Walk:** target horizontal speed `±180 px/s`. Acceleration toward target
  `1600 px/s²` on ground, `900 px/s²` in air. Friction (no input) decelerates at
  `2000 px/s²` (ground), `300 px/s²` (air drag).
- **Gravity:** `1800 px/s²`, clamped to terminal velocity `1200 px/s`. Fast-fall (`S`)
  raises gravity to `3000 px/s²`.
- **Jump:** initial impulse sets `vy = -620 px/s` (apex ≈ 107 px ≈ 3.3 tiles).
  **Variable height:** releasing jump before apex while `vy < -250` clamps `vy = -250`
  (short hop). **Coyote time:** 6 frames (0.1 s) after leaving a ledge a jump still
  works. **Jump buffer:** a jump pressed up to 6 frames before landing fires on landing.
- **Double jump** (unlocked via Cloud Boots item): one extra `vy = -540 px/s` while
  airborne; resets on ground contact.
- **Step-up:** when walking into a single 1-tile-high ledge while grounded, auto-climb it
  (no jump needed) if the tile above the ledge is clear.

### 4.2 Tilemap collision

Player AABB is **24×46 px** (narrower than a tile so they fit 1-wide gaps). Collision is
**swept axis-separated** against the tilemap:

1. Integrate X, resolve against solid tiles overlapping the new AABB (push out, zero `vx`).
2. Integrate Y, resolve against solid tiles (push out, zero `vy`; set `grounded` if the
   correction was upward).
3. **One-way platforms:** collide only when `vy ≥ 0` (falling) and the player's previous
   bottom was above the platform top; ignored when holding `S` (drop-through) for 8 frames.

Only the up-to **~3×2 tiles** overlapping the AABB are tested per axis (O(1) per entity),
queried from the chunk store (§7.2). Sub-pixel positions are kept as `float32`.

### 4.3 Mining

- Each solid tile has **hardness `H`** (hit-points of mining progress). Mining applies
  `toolPower × dt` of progress per tick while LMB is held on that tile.
- **Tool tiers** (pickaxe/axe/drill). `toolPower` and a **tier gate** (minimum tier to
  mine at all):

  | Tool | toolPower (H/s) | Tier | Can mine up to |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Fist | 1.5 | 0 | Dirt, Sand, Wood, Leaves |
  | Wood Pickaxe | 6 | 1 | Stone, Coal, Copper |
  | Stone Pickaxe | 10 | 2 | + Iron, Silver |
  | Iron Pickaxe | 16 | 3 | + Gold, Gems |
  | Diamond Drill | 28 | 4 | + Obsidian, Bedrockish |

  If the tile's required tier > tool tier, progress is **0** (cannot mine) and the tile
  flashes red. Mining a tile below your tier still works at full `toolPower`.
- **Breaking:** when accumulated progress ≥ `H`, the tile is set to `Air`, a **drop item**
  spawns (§4.4), a break particle burst plays, and lighting/neighbors are re-evaluated.
- **Auto-target switch:** if the cursor moves off the in-progress tile, progress on the
  old tile **decays at 2×H/s** (so flicking the mouse loses partial progress).
- **Wall mining** (`Ctrl`): mines background walls (half hardness, no tool-tier gate above
  the wall's own tier) and drops the wall item.

### 4.4 Drops & pickup

- Breaking a tile spawns a **dropped-item entity** (16×16 px) at the tile center with a
  small random pop velocity (`vx ∈ [-40,40]`, `vy = -120`). Drops obey gravity + tilemap
  collision and rest on the ground.
- **Magnet pickup:** drops within **64 px** of the player accelerate toward them at
  `1400 px/s²`; on contact they merge into inventory (stack up to item max). If inventory
  is full the drop stays in the world.
- Drops **despawn after 300 s**; identical drops within 12 px **merge** into one stack to
  cap entity count.
- Drop tables can be probabilistic (e.g. Stone → 1× Stone always; Coal Ore → 1× Coal +
  10% bonus Coal).

### 4.5 Placement / building

- Right-click places **1** of the selected placeable item at the cursor tile if: the tile
  is `Air`, it is within reach (§3), it is supported (adjacent to a solid tile, or it's a
  wall placement which only needs a neighbor wall/tile), and the player AABB does not
  overlap the target (can't trap yourself in a solid block).
- Placing decrements the stack by 1. Placing a wall fills the **background layer**;
  placing a block fills the **foreground (solid) layer**.
- **Doors, torches, platforms, chests, stations** are special placeables with their own
  footprint and interaction (door = 1×3 toggling solidity; torch = light + non-solid;
  platform = one-way; chest = 1-tile storage of 20 slots; station = crafting anchor).

### 4.6 Health, hunger, damage

- **Health:** max 100 HP. Regenerates `+1 HP/s` only when **hunger > 50%** and no damage
  taken in the last 5 s.
- **Hunger:** 0–100, drains `0.5/s` while active (`1.0/s` while mining/running). At
  **hunger 0**, lose `2 HP/s` (starvation). Eating food restores hunger (see item table).
- **Fall damage:** falling faster than `900 px/s` on landing deals
  `(vy - 900) / 15` HP.
- **Contact damage:** enemies deal damage on AABB overlap with an **invulnerability
  window of 0.7 s** after a hit; a hit also applies knockback (`vx = ±300`, `vy = -250`).
- **Drowning:** submerged in water (if water enabled) > 10 s → `5 HP/s`.
- **Death:** HP ≤ 0 → drop a configurable % of inventory as world drops, respawn at the
  player's **bed** (if placed & valid) else **world spawn**, after a 3 s fade.

### 4.7 Combat

- Melee weapons swing in a **90° arc** toward the cursor over 0.25 s; the hit-test is a
  capsule from player center to `reach` px. Damage = weapon base × (1 + 0.1·tier).
- Ranged (bow) consumes 1 arrow, fires a projectile entity (`speed 700 px/s`, gravity
  `600 px/s²`, despawn on tile/enemy hit).
- Enemies have HP, take knockback, and flash white for 0.1 s on hit.

### 4.8 Day/night cycle

- A full day is **`dayLengthSeconds = 840 s`** (14 min) at default. Phases by normalized
  time `t ∈ [0,1)`: **Dawn** `[0.0,0.1)`, **Day** `[0.1,0.45)`, **Dusk** `[0.45,0.5)`,
  **Night** `[0.5,0.95)`, **Pre-dawn** `[0.95,1.0)`.
- Ambient sky light lerps with `t` (see §8.5). Enemy spawning is gated to **Night** and
  to **dark tiles** at any time (caves are always "night" underground).
- Sleeping in a valid bed at night fast-forwards `t` to `0.0` of the next day if no
  enemies are within 480 px.

### 4.9 Enemy spawning & AI

- **Spawn cadence:** every 1.0 s the spawner attempts spawns while `enemyCount < cap`.
  `cap = 6 + floor(daysSurvived × 1.5)` capped at 30.
- **Where:** pick a random **active** (loaded) tile column 240–640 px from the player that
  is (a) dark (light < 0.15) or surface-at-night, (b) has a 2-tile-tall air pocket on a
  solid floor, and (c) is **off-screen** (outside the camera + 64 px margin). Surface
  night spawns favor flat ground; cave spawns favor open air pockets.
- **Despawn:** enemies > 1600 px from player or in daylight surface light despawn.
- **AI state machine** (per enemy archetype, see §5): `Idle → Patrol → Chase → Attack →
  (Flee | Dead)`. Walkers do simple "move toward player X; jump if blocked by a 1-tile
  wall and player is higher"; flyers ignore tile collision and steer directly; jumpers
  leap on a cooldown. Pathing is **greedy local** (no A*) — acceptable for a v1; enemies
  may get stuck on terrain, which is fine (the design leans on it).

### 4.10 Lighting (optional in v1, specced for v1.1)

- Per-tile light value `0–1`. **Sources:** sky (top-down flood scaled by day phase),
  torches/lava (`emit = 0.9`, radius ~10 tiles). Propagation = **BFS flood fill** with
  attenuation `−0.08` per air tile and `−0.16` per solid tile, recomputed incrementally on
  tile change within the affected region (not the whole world).
- Light drives both **rendering darkness** (§8.5) and **spawn eligibility** (§4.9).
- If disabled in v1, treat underground as uniformly dark and surface as day-phase lit.

## 5. Entities / Game Objects

```fsharp
type EntityId = int

type Facing = Left | Right

type AiState = Idle | Patrol | Chase | Attack | Flee | Dead

// Non-tile world actors (enemies, dropped items, projectiles, the player)
type Enemy =
    { Id        : EntityId
      Kind      : EnemyKind
      Pos       : Vec2          // px, world space (entity origin = AABB center-bottom)
      Vel       : Vec2          // px/s
      Hp        : float32
      Facing    : Facing
      State     : AiState
      StateTime : float32       // seconds in current state
      Cooldown  : float32 }     // attack/jump cooldown

and EnemyKind =
    | Slime    // jumper
    | Crawler  // walker, melee
    | Bat      // flyer
    | Skeleton // walker, ranged (throws bones)
    | Brute    // walker, tanky, night-only

type DroppedItem =
    { Id : EntityId; Item : ItemStack; Pos : Vec2; Vel : Vec2; Age : float32 }

type Projectile =
    { Id : EntityId; Pos : Vec2; Vel : Vec2; Damage : float32
      FromPlayer : bool; Life : float32 }
```

**Entity catalogue:**

| Entity | Size px | HP | Speed px/s | Damage | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Player | 24×46 | 100 | 180 walk | weapon | §4 |
| Slime | 32×24 | 14 | 90 (hop) | 6 | Jumper: leaps toward player every 1.4 s; arc hop `vy=-420` |
| Crawler | 28×40 | 22 | 70 | 9 | Walker: chases on X, jumps 1-tile walls |
| Bat | 28×20 | 10 | 130 | 5 | Flyer: sine-weave pursuit, ignores tiles, flees in daylight |
| Skeleton | 26×44 | 34 | 60 | 8 + ranged 7 | Walker: keeps 160 px range, throws bone projectiles |
| Brute | 40×60 | 80 | 50 | 20 | Walker: slow, heavy knockback, night-only, drops good loot |
| Dropped item | 16×16 | — | — | — | Gravity + magnet (§4.4) |
| Projectile | 8×8 | — | — | varies | Linear/gravity, despawn on hit |

**Lifecycle:** enemies created by the spawner (§4.9), destroyed on death (drop loot) or
despawn; dropped items created by mining/death/`Q`, destroyed on pickup/despawn/merge;
projectiles created on attack, destroyed on hit/timeout.

## 6. World / Levels / Progression

**Logical resolution:** 1280×720 px. **Tile:** 32×32 px → viewport shows ~40×23 tiles.

**World dimensions (default "small"):** `WorldWidth = 4200 tiles`, `WorldHeight = 1200
tiles` (≈ 134 km² of tiles). Stored in **chunks of 64×64 tiles** → 66×19 ≈ **1254 chunks**.

**Vertical layer bands** (by tile Y, top = 0):

| Band | Y range (tiles) | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Sky / Air | 0 – ~ surface | Floating islands (rare), open air |
| Surface | heightmap ±20 | Grass, dirt, trees, surface enemies at night |
| Underground (dirt) | surface → 300 | Dirt, stone pockets, small caves, copper/iron |
| Caverns (stone) | 300 – 800 | Stone, large caves, iron/silver/gold, gems, water |
| Deep | 800 – 1180 | Dense stone, obsidian, lava pools, gold/gems, Brutes |
| Underworld floor | 1180 – 1200 | Bedrockish (tier-4 gated) boundary |

**Biomes (horizontal regions on the surface)** selected by a low-frequency noise:
**Forest** (default, trees+grass), **Desert** (sand, cacti, deeper to sandstone),
**Tundra** (snow blocks, ice, slippery friction ×0.5), **Jungle** (dense vines, mud,
tougher enemies). Biome affects surface tiles, tree type, and a spawn-weight table.

**Progression / difficulty ramp:** gated by tool tier (§4.3) — you physically cannot reach
deep ore without crafting up. Difficulty also ramps with `daysSurvived` via the spawn cap
(§4.9) and unlocking the night-only Brute after day 2. No discrete "levels"; the world is
one continuous space and depth is the difficulty axis.

## 7. State Model (Elmish/MVU)

### 7.1 The central challenge: a huge mutable world inside an immutable Model

A 4200×1200 tile world is **5.04 M tiles**. Naively, MVU wants the `Model` to be an
immutable value that `update` returns a fresh copy of each tick. Copying 5 M tiles per
frame is impossible (and even structural-sharing a giant array on every mined block is
wasteful). We resolve this **honestly** rather than pretending the world is cheap:

1. **The world is not value-copied per tick.** Tiles live in **chunk arrays**
   (`Tile[]` of length 4096 per 64×64 chunk). These flat arrays are **mutated in place**
   during the simulation step. The `Model` holds *references* to chunk records; mining a
   block mutates `chunk.Tiles.[i]` and bumps `chunk.Version`, it does **not** allocate a
   new 5 M-tile structure.
2. **The Model stays "morally immutable" at the boundaries that matter.** Player,
   inventory, time, and the *set* of loaded chunks are ordinary immutable F# records/maps
   updated functionally — those are small and benefit from MVU's clarity and testability.
   The tile payload is the one deliberate, documented escape hatch: a **mutable simulation
   buffer** owned by the model, never shared, never aliased into the view.
3. **Discipline that keeps it sound:** (a) only `update`/the sim step writes tiles, on the
   single update thread; (b) the view reads tiles but never writes; (c) each chunk carries
   a `Version : int` and `Dirty : bool` so the renderer and lighting can detect changes
   without diffing arrays; (d) world mutations also emit a small immutable **`WorldEvent`**
   list (e.g. `TileChanged (x,y,old,new)`) so save/undo/networking could be layered later
   without reading the whole grid.
4. **Why this is acceptable:** the alternative (persistent immutable tile maps) costs
   allocation and GC pressure for zero gameplay benefit; the tile grid is a textbook case
   of a large, hot, locally-mutated buffer. We pay the cost of explicit mutation discipline
   to buy a flat-array performance profile, and keep MVU purity for everything small.

### 7.2 Chunk store & streaming

- `ChunkKey = (cx, cy)`. Chunks generated lazily from the seed on first access and cached.
- **Active set:** chunks whose bounds intersect `camera ∪ 2-chunk margin` are **loaded**
  (generated/simulated/rendered). Chunks beyond a larger **unload radius** are flushed to
  the save store and dropped from memory. Simulation (entities, mining, lighting) only
  runs on loaded chunks. Rendering only touches loaded **visible** chunks.
- Each chunk: `{ Key; Tiles: Tile[4096]; Walls: Tile[4096]; Light: float32[4096];
  Version: int; Dirty: bool; Generated: bool }`.

```fsharp
type TileType =
    | Air | Dirt | Grass | Stone | Sand | Wood | Leaves
    | Coal | Copper | Iron | Silver | Gold | Gem | Obsidian | Bedrockish
    | Torch | Platform | Door of bool   // bool = open
    | Chest of int      // -> chest store id
    | Station of StationKind
    | Water of byte     // 0..8 fill level

type Tile = { Type: TileType }   // 1 byte type tag in practice; packed in arrays

type StationKind = Workbench | Furnace | Anvil | Cookpot | Loom

type Vec2 = { X: float32; Y: float32 }

type Player =
    { Pos: Vec2; Vel: Vec2; Facing: Facing
      Grounded: bool; CanDoubleJump: bool
      Hp: float32; Hunger: float32; InvulnTimer: float32
      MiningTile: (int*int) option; MiningProgress: float32 }

type ItemStack = { Item: ItemId; Count: int }

type Inventory =
    { Hotbar: ItemStack option []   // length 10
      Main:   ItemStack option []   // length 30 (3x10)
      Selected: int }               // 0..9 hotbar index

type TimeState = { DayTime: float32; Day: int }   // DayTime in [0,1)

type World =
    { Seed: int
      Width: int; Height: int
      Chunks: System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<int*int, Chunk> // mutable cache
      Chests: Map<int, ItemStack option []>
      LoadedKeys: Set<int*int> }

type Model =
    { World:     World
      Player:    Player
      Inventory: Inventory
      Enemies:   Enemy list
      Drops:     DroppedItem list
      Projectiles: Projectile list
      Time:      TimeState
      Camera:    Vec2
      Input:     InputState        // current held keys + mouse tile + buttons
      Ui:        UiState           // Playing | InventoryOpen | Paused | Dead | Title
      Rng:       RngState          // deterministic sim RNG (separate from worldgen)
      DaysSurvived: int
      Events:    WorldEvent list } // transient, drained each frame
```

### 7.3 Msg

```fsharp
type Msg =
    // input (edge + held captured by subscription)
    | KeyDown of Key | KeyUp of Key
    | MouseMove of px:Vec2
    | MouseDown of Button | MouseUp of Button
    | WheelDelta of int
    // simulation
    | Tick of dt:float32
    // ui / lifecycle
    | OpenInventory | CloseInventory | Pause | Resume
    | StartNewWorld of seed:int | LoadWorld of slot:int | SaveWorld of slot:int
    | Respawn
    // async results
    | WorldSaved of slot:int | WorldLoaded of Model | ChunkGenerated of Chunk
```

### 7.4 update — key transitions

- **`Tick dt`** runs the **fixed-step simulation** (§7.5) and is the only message that
  advances physics/time. Variable display frames between ticks just re-render the latest
  model (no state change) so rendering can exceed/trail 60 Hz safely.
- **`MouseDown Left`** sets the mining target (or triggers a weapon swing if a weapon is
  selected); **held** state is read each `Tick` to apply mining progress.
- **`MouseDown Right`** attempts a placement (validates reach/support/overlap, decrements
  the stack, mutates the foreground/background chunk array, marks chunk `Dirty`, emits
  `TileChanged`).
- **`KeyDown Digit n`** / **`WheelDelta`** changes `Inventory.Selected`.
- **`OpenInventory`** sets `UiState=InventoryOpen` and **pauses simulation ticks** (or
  not, configurable); crafting commands are dispatched while open.
- **Craft message** (a UI action) checks the recipe table against combined inventory +
  in-range station, removes inputs, adds outputs (§Crafting).
- **`StartNewWorld seed`** seeds both `worldgen` (deterministic, from `seed`) and the sim
  `Rng`, generates spawn-area chunks, places the player on the surface heightmap.
- **`SaveWorld`/`LoadWorld`** are `Cmd`s to an async persistence service (§13); the world
  array work happens off the update thread and returns `WorldSaved`/`WorldLoaded`.

### 7.5 The simulation tick (ordered, fixed dt)

Per `Tick dt` (dt = 1/60), in this order, to keep determinism:

1. **Time:** advance `DayTime`, recompute phase; increment `Day`/`DaysSurvived` on wrap.
2. **Streaming:** update active chunk set from camera; queue gen/unload (gen may be async).
3. **Input → intents:** read held keys for movement; resolve mining/placement intents.
4. **Player physics:** acceleration → integrate X (collide) → integrate Y (collide) →
   grounded/coyote/jump-buffer; fall damage on landing.
5. **Mining/placement:** apply mining progress to target tile; break → spawn drop + emit
   event + mark dirty + flag light recompute region.
6. **Survival:** hunger drain, regen/starvation, drowning, invuln timer decay.
7. **Enemies:** spawner attempt → per-enemy AI state machine → integrate + collide →
   contact damage → death/loot.
8. **Projectiles & drops:** integrate, collide, resolve hits, magnet pickup, despawn/merge.
9. **Lighting:** if any tile changed, run incremental BFS over affected regions only.
10. **Camera:** lerp toward player (`smooth = 8/s`), clamp to world bounds.
11. **Drain `Events`** into the save/undo/audio pipelines; clear for next tick.

If the renderer falls behind, run **up to 5 catch-up ticks** per frame then drop the rest
(spiral-of-death guard).

### 7.6 view (pure)

`view model dispatch` produces a **declarative scene description** (an immutable list of
draw commands / a retained scene tree) that the Skia layer renders. It reads tiles from
chunk arrays (read-only) and never mutates the model. It diffs nothing itself — it relies
on chunk `Version`/`Dirty` and entity lists; the Skia layer (§8) caches chunk surfaces.

### 7.7 Subscriptions

- **`Tick`:** a fixed 60 Hz accumulator-driven timer dispatches `Tick (1/60)` (or N of
  them) using a wall-clock accumulator; `dt` is constant for determinism.
- **Input:** keyboard/mouse events from the host window dispatch `KeyDown/Up`,
  `MouseMove/Down/Up`, `WheelDelta`. Edge vs. held is reconstructed in `InputState`.
- **Async chunk gen / save / load** completions dispatch their result messages.

## 8. Rendering (Skia 2D)

**Coordinate system:** world space in px, Y-down. Camera transform = translate by
`-Camera + (640,360)` so the player is centered; all world draws happen under this matrix.
UI draws in screen space (no camera transform).

### 8.1 Layer / draw order (back to front)

1. **Sky gradient** (full-screen, day-phase colored).
2. **Parallax background** (distant hills/cave wall, scrolls at 0.3× camera).
3. **Background wall layer** (placed walls; drawn darker, `−25%` brightness).
4. **Foreground tile layer** (solid tiles).
5. **Dropped items** (16×16 icons).
6. **Enemies & projectiles.**
7. **Player** (+ held-tool swing arc).
8. **Tile cursor highlight** + mining crack overlay (progress → 1 of 4 crack frames).
9. **Lighting overlay** (multiply darkness, §8.5).
10. **Particles** (break bursts, hit sparks, footstep dust).
11. **HUD / UI / panels** (§9), screen space.

### 8.2 Chunk surface caching (key performance technique)

Each visible chunk's static tile art (layers 3–4) is rendered once into an **off-screen
Skia surface (2048×2048 px per 64×64 chunk)** and re-blitted each frame. The cache is
invalidated when `chunk.Version` changes (a tile was mined/placed) — then only that chunk's
surface (and the lighting region) is re-rendered. With ~6–9 visible chunks, per-frame work
is ~9 textured quad blits + dynamic entities, not 920 individual tile draws.

### 8.3 Tile drawing

Tiles are drawn from a **texture atlas** (`SKImage` + source rects) by `TileType`. Variant
selection: a 2-bit hash of `(x,y)` picks 1 of up to 4 variant tiles to break tiling.
**Auto-tiling** (Terraria-style 47-mask blob) chooses edge/corner sub-tiles from the
8-neighborhood so dirt/stone borders look smooth. Grass overlays a top fringe sprite where
air is above.

### 8.4 Palette (hex)

| Element | Color |
|---|---|
| Sky (day) | `#7EC0EE` |
| Sky (night) | `#0B1026` |
| Dirt | `#7A4B2B` |
| Grass top | `#4FA63B` |
| Stone | `#6E6E73` |
| Coal | `#2B2B2B` on stone |
| Copper | `#B66A3C` | 
| Iron | `#C9C0B6` |
| Silver | `#D9DCE3` |
| Gold | `#E8C24A` |
| Gem | `#46C7E0` |
| Water | `#2D6CDF` @ 60% alpha |
| Torch light | `#FFD27A` |
| Player | `#E8E0D0` |
| Mining cursor | `#FFFFFF` @ 35% |
| Tile-tier-fail flash | `#E2453C` |

Fonts: HUD numerals in a bitmap/monospace font, 16 px; panel labels 14 px.

### 8.5 Lighting render

Per-tile light `0–1` is upsampled to a low-res lightmap and drawn as a **multiply layer**
(black at light 0, transparent at light 1) over the world, smoothly interpolated (bilinear)
so light gradients are soft. Sky light scales the surface band by day phase; torches add
warm radial gradients. When lighting is disabled (v1), substitute a flat day-phase ambient
multiply over the whole screen and a constant dark multiply below the surface band.

### 8.6 Redraw strategy

Full redraw at 60 FPS (game world is always animating: day phase, entities, particles).
The expensive static tile work is amortized by §8.2 chunk caches, so a steady frame is
~10 blits + a few hundred dynamic quads, well within budget (§13).

## 9. UI / HUD / Screens

**Screens:** `Title` (New World w/ seed field, Load slot list, Quit) → `Playing` →
`InventoryOpen` (overlay, sim paused) → `Paused` (Esc) → `Dead` (respawn/quit).

**HUD (Playing):**

- **Hearts bar** top-left: 100 HP as 10 heart icons (or a bar), `12px` from edges.
- **Hunger bar** under hearts: orange fill, label `Hunger`.
- **Hotbar** bottom-center: 10 slots (40×40 px each), selected slot highlighted with a
  `#FFD27A` 2px border, item count bottom-right of each slot, slot number top-left.
- **Clock / day** top-right: a small sun/moon dial showing `DayTime`, plus `Day N` text.
- **Minimap** (`Tab`): top-right inset, 200×200 px, downsampled tile colors + player dot.

**Inventory panel (`E`):** centered, shows the 30-slot main grid + 10 hotbar + the
**crafting list** (recipes the player can currently make given inventory + in-range
station) with input/output icons; clicking a craftable entry crafts one (shift = max).
Drag to move/split stacks; trash slot bottom-right.

**Tooltips:** hovering a slot/recipe shows name, stats (tool power, damage, hunger
restore), and required station.

## 10. Audio

Checklist (audio optional in v1):

| Event | SFX |
|---|---|
| Mining hit (per tile material) | dull/clink/metallic by group |
| Tile breaks | crumble pop |
| Place tile | soft thud |
| Pick up item | light chime |
| Craft success | tool-clatter |
| Player hurt | grunt |
| Enemy hurt / die | squish / shatter |
| Jump / land | whoosh / thud |
| Eat food | crunch |
| Open/close inventory | leather flap |
| Low health (HP<20) | heartbeat loop |

Music cues: calm **Day** loop, tense **Night** loop, ambient **Cave** loop (deep band),
short **Death** sting. Cross-fade on phase/band change over 2 s.

## 11. Win / Loss / Scoring

There is no terminal win. **Progression goals** (used as the "score"/achievement spine):

| Tier goal | Requirement |
|---|---|
| T1 Settler | Craft Workbench + Wood tools, survive Night 1 |
| T2 Miner | Craft Furnace, smelt Copper/Iron, Stone→Iron tools |
| T3 Delver | Craft Anvil, reach Caverns, Iron armor |
| T4 Deepcore | Diamond Drill, reach Deep band, defeat a Brute |

**Score (optional leaderboard metric):** `score = 100·daysSurvived + 50·tierReached +
Σ(rare ore mined) − 25·deaths`.

**Loss:** HP ≤ 0. **Softcore (default):** respawn at bed/spawn, drop 50% of coins/items
as world drops at death site (recoverable). **Hardcore (toggle):** world becomes
read-only "tombstone"; run ends.

## 13. Technical Notes

**Performance budget (target 60 FPS = 16.7 ms/frame):**

- **Sim step ≤ 4 ms:** physics is O(active entities) with cap 30 enemies + ~80 drops +
  ~40 projectiles ≈ 150 dynamic bodies, each O(1) tile collision. Mining/lighting work is
  bounded to the changed region. Streaming gen is **async** (off-thread) and never blocks
  the tick — chunks pop in via `ChunkGenerated`.
- **Render ≤ 10 ms:** ~9 cached chunk surface blits (layers 3–4) + ~150 dynamic quads +
  lighting multiply + HUD. Chunk surface re-render only on `Version` bump.
- **Memory:** a loaded chunk ≈ 4096 tiles + 4096 walls (1 byte tag each) + 4096 light
  floats ≈ 24 KB data + a 2048² surface (~16 MB GPU if RGBA8 — so cap **resident chunk
  surfaces to the visible+margin set**, ~12–16, and recycle the rest). Off-screen chunk
  *data* may stay cached; their *surfaces* are evicted.

**Fixed vs. variable timestep:** **fixed** 1/60 simulation via accumulator; rendering is
variable and interpolates entity positions between the last two sim states for smoothness
(store `PrevPos` per dynamic entity; render at `lerp(prev, cur, alpha)`).

**Determinism / RNG:** two seeded streams. **Worldgen RNG** is a pure function of the
world `Seed` and tile coordinates (use a hashed-coordinate noise so any tile/chunk is
reproducible regardless of generation order — *not* a single sequential PRNG, so streaming
order can't change the world). **Sim RNG** (`Rng: RngState`, a small splitmix/xorshift) is
seeded once and advanced only inside the ordered tick, so a recorded input log replays
identically. Floats in sim are `float32` with the fixed dt to bound divergence.

**World generation pipeline (deterministic from `Seed`):**

1. **Heightmap:** 1D fractal value-noise over X → surface Y per column (amplitude ~25
   tiles, multi-octave); biome noise selects surface material/tree set.
2. **Strata fill:** below surface fill Dirt→Stone by depth band; sprinkle Sand in desert.
3. **Caves:** 2D Perlin/Worley noise; tiles where `noise > caveThreshold(depth)` become
   Air; threshold eases with depth so caverns are bigger deeper. Connect with a few
   tunneling walks seeded by coordinate hash.
4. **Ore veins:** for each ore, a 3D-ish blob noise gated by depth band + `oreRichness`
   places veins (e.g. iron only below Y=120, gold below Y=480). Vein = small flood blob
   of 4–16 tiles.
5. **Liquids:** fill enclosed low pockets in caverns with Water; lava pools in Deep.
6. **Decor / structures:** trees on grass, cacti in desert, rare floating islands, the
   occasional small chest cave with loot.
7. **Spawn point:** flat-ish surface column near world center; clear a 6×6 air pocket.

A chunk is generated by evaluating steps 1–6 only for its tile coordinates — pure and
order-independent, satisfying the determinism acceptance test.

**Persistence (save/load):**

- Save format: header `{ seed, width, height, day, daysSurvived, player, inventory,
  time, chests }` + a **chunk delta store**: only chunks whose tiles differ from the
  deterministic worldgen baseline are serialized (RLE-compressed `TileType` runs per
  chunk, foreground + walls). Pristine chunks are regenerated from `seed` on load → tiny
  saves. Enemies/drops/projectiles are **not** persisted (re-spawn on load).
- Writing is async (`Cmd` → background); a save lock prevents mutation mid-write by
  snapshotting dirty chunk deltas under the update thread, then compressing off-thread.
- **Round-trip guarantee:** `load(save(model))` reproduces identical world tiles, player,
  inventory, time, and chests (modulo non-persisted transient entities).

**Edge cases:** placing a block on yourself (blocked); mining the tile you stand on
(allowed, you fall); falling out of the world bottom (clamp at Bedrockish, never below);
inventory full on pickup (drop persists); crafting with exactly enough materials
(consumed, no negative counts); two players' worth of input in one frame (N/A, single
player); chunk gen lag (player on ungenerated chunk → treated as solid until generated to
avoid falling through); save during low memory (stream chunk deltas, don't hold all).

## 14. Acceptance Criteria (test scenarios)

1. **Worldgen determinism (seed).**
   **Given** a new world created with seed `12345`,
   **When** I read the `TileType` at tile `(2100, 350)` and at `(2100, 350)` again after
   regenerating that chunk from the same seed (or in a second fresh world with seed
   `12345`),
   **Then** both reads return the **identical** `TileType`, and a world with seed `99999`
   differs in at least one of a sampled 1000-tile set (determinism + seed sensitivity).

2. **Mining a block yields a drop and clears the tile.**
   **Given** the player holds a Stone Pickaxe (tier 2) and targets a Stone tile (H=10) at a
   reachable, adjacent tile,
   **When** LMB is held for `H / toolPower = 10/10 = 1.0 s` of `Tick`s,
   **Then** the tile becomes `Air`, the chunk's `Version` increments and `Dirty=true`, and
   exactly one `Stone` `DroppedItem` spawns at the tile center.

3. **Tool-tier gate blocks under-tier mining.**
   **Given** the player holds a Wood Pickaxe (tier 1) targeting an Iron tile (tier 2),
   **When** LMB is held for 3 s,
   **Then** mining progress stays `0`, the tile is unchanged, and the tile shows the
   tier-fail flash; equipping a Stone Pickaxe then mines it normally.

4. **Drop pickup into inventory.**
   **Given** a `Stone` drop rests 40 px from the player and the player has an empty/partial
   Stone slot,
   **When** the next ticks run (within magnet radius 64 px),
   **Then** the drop accelerates to the player and is removed from the world, and the
   Stone stack count increases by exactly 1.

5. **Crafting consumes inputs and produces output.**
   **Given** the inventory holds 10 Wood and no Workbench exists, UI shows "Workbench"
   craftable,
   **When** the player crafts Workbench,
   **Then** Wood decreases by 10 and one Workbench item is added; **and given** 6 Wood with
   a Workbench within range, crafting Wood Pickaxe removes 6 Wood and adds 1 Wood Pickaxe;
   **and** attempting to craft with only 5 Wood is rejected with no state change.

6. **Tilemap collision (no tunneling).**
   **Given** the player stands on a solid floor with a solid wall directly to the right,
   **When** `D` is held for 2 s at walk speed,
   **Then** the player's X position never enters a solid tile (AABB stays outside), `vx`
   is zeroed at the wall, and `grounded` stays true; **and** a player falling at terminal
   velocity onto a 1-tile-thick floor lands on top of it without passing through.

7. **Jump height & coyote/buffer.**
   **Given** the player is grounded,
   **When** jump is pressed and held,
   **Then** peak height is `≈107 px` (within ±4 px); **and** pressing jump within 6 frames
   after walking off a ledge still produces a jump (coyote); **and** a short-tap releases
   early and peaks lower than a full hold.

8. **Night enemy spawn (and day suppression).**
   **Given** `DayTime` enters the Night phase (`t ≥ 0.5`) and `enemyCount < cap`,
   **When** ~1 s of ticks elapse with a valid dark, off-screen, floored spawn column in the
   active set,
   **Then** at least one surface enemy spawns within 240–640 px, off-screen; **and** when
   `DayTime` returns to Day, no new surface enemies spawn and exposed surface enemies
   despawn/flee, while cave (dark) enemies may still spawn.

9. **Enemy contact damage + invulnerability.**
   **Given** a Crawler overlaps the player AABB,
   **When** the overlap occurs,
   **Then** the player loses 9 HP once, gains a 0.7 s invuln window during which further
   overlaps deal 0 damage, and receives knockback; after the window a new overlap damages
   again.

10. **Hunger & starvation.**
    **Given** hunger is at 1 and HP at 100,
    **When** ticks run until hunger reaches 0 and 5 more seconds pass,
    **Then** HP has dropped by `≈10` (2 HP/s starvation) and HP regen does not trigger;
    eating an Apple raises hunger by 20 and (after 5 s damage-free, hunger>50) regen
    resumes.

11. **Placement validity.**
    **Given** the player selects Dirt and aims at an `Air` tile adjacent to a solid tile
    within reach,
    **When** RMB is clicked,
    **Then** the tile becomes Dirt and the Dirt stack decreases by 1; **and** clicking on a
    tile overlapping the player AABB, or out of reach, or with no solid neighbor, performs
    no placement and consumes no item.

12. **Save/load round-trip.**
    **Given** a world (seed `7`) where the player has mined a 5×5 hole, placed 3 torches,
    stored 12 Iron in a chest, and it is Day 3 at `DayTime=0.62`,
    **When** the world is saved to slot 1 and then loaded into a fresh model,
    **Then** the loaded world has the identical hole (those tiles = Air), the 3 torches,
    the chest containing 12 Iron, player position/HP/hunger/inventory, `Day=3`,
    `DayTime≈0.62` (within one tick), and all **pristine** (unmodified) chunks regenerate
    identically from seed `7`.

13. **Chunk streaming correctness.**
    **Given** the player walks 200 tiles east,
    **When** chunks enter/leave the active set,
    **Then** newly visible chunks are generated/loaded before they render (no falling
    through ungenerated tiles), unloaded chunks' surfaces are evicted, and tile reads in
    the visible region are always valid.

14. **Fixed-timestep determinism (input replay).**
    **Given** a recorded input log over 600 ticks from seed `42`,
    **When** the log is replayed twice from the same initial model,
    **Then** the resulting player position, inventory, and enemy positions are bit-identical
    across both runs (deterministic sim).

15. **Death and respawn.**
    **Given** softcore mode, a placed valid bed, and the player at 5 HP,
    **When** the player takes lethal damage,
    **Then** after a 3 s fade the player respawns at the bed with full HP, 50% of dropped
    items appear as recoverable world drops at the death site, and `deaths` increments.

## 15. Stretch Goals

Ranked, out of scope for v1:

1. **Full dynamic lighting** (§4.10/§8.5) enabled by default with colored light.
2. **Liquids simulation** — flowing water/lava with pressure, not just static pockets.
3. **Bosses & events** — a summonable boss, "blood moon" high-spawn nights.
4. **Background trees/furniture & wiring** — multi-layer decoration, logic gates/wiring.
5. **NPC villagers** that move into player-built valid houses and sell goods.
6. **More biomes & depth layers** — corruption/hallow spread, an underworld with lava sea.
7. **Multiplayer** — the `WorldEvent` stream and chunk deltas are designed to extend here.
8. **Map/quest progression**, accessory slots, buff system, fishing.
9. **Procedural structures** — dungeons, abandoned mineshafts with loot and traps.
10. **Controller support & remappable bindings.**

## Menu & configuration — the shared game shell

Hollowreach uses the **generic FS.GG game shell** (FS-GG/FS.GG.Rendering#991) — the same
menu/start screen and settings every FS.GG game shares — rather than a bespoke per-game menu.
Hollowreach supplies only its **name**, its **key→command map** (the rebindable actions from
§3 Controls), and its play `update`/`view`; the shell provides everything below.

- **Main menu / start screen** — the game's name (**Hollowreach**) as the title label, with
  **Start**, **Config**, and **Exit**. This is the shell home for the §9 Title actions (New
  World with seed field / Load slot list / Quit); the new-world seed field and load-slot list
  are surfaced as Hollowreach-specific rows over the shell's Start entry.
- **`Esc` from gameplay** opens the pause menu (Resume · Config · Exit to menu) over the
  same shell; `Esc` again resumes. This is the shell home for the §3 `Esc` pause / close-
  panel action and the §9 Paused screen (the `E` inventory panel remains a separate in-game
  overlay, not a shell menu).
- **Config / Settings**, all applied live and persisted across restarts:
  - **Screen resolution** and **fullscreen** (windowed / borderless / fullscreen), driven
    through the SkiaViewer window-behavior + `LogicalCanvas` letterbox seam — the same seam
    that scales the logical 1280×720 viewport (§6, §8) to the window.
  - **Key rebinding** — the player remaps Hollowreach's controls (the §3 actions: walk
    left/right, jump, fast-fall/drop-through, mine/attack, place, hotbar cycle/select,
    inventory, drop, interact, eat, wall-mine modifier, minimap, pause) via the
    `Controls.KeyRebind` UI over the `KeyboardInput.Keymap` mechanism; bindings persist via
    `KeymapCodec` (JSON), beside Hollowreach's save data (§13). Mouse move/LMB/RMB stay as
    the primary aim-and-act inputs; the rebindable set is the keyboard command map.
  - (Game-specific rows such as hardcore mode (§11) or volume may be added as extra Config
    rows, but the menu, Esc routing, display settings, and rebind screen come from the shell.)

The shell is pointer- and keyboard-navigable over the interactive Controls host (the
`fs-gg-skiaviewer` "game → pointer host" recipe). It is a shared dependency, so Hollowreach
does **not** re-specify menu-stack/cursor/settings machinery of its own.

## 16. Milestone Roadmap

Delivery is milestone-sequenced (M0..Mn), each a small, demonstrable slice grounded in the
sections above. Earlier milestones stand up the deterministic tile-world simulation core;
later ones layer survival, enemies, lighting, the shared shell, audio, save/load, and the
acceptance harness.

### M0 — Scaffold & fixed-step loop
Stand up the Elmish/MVU app (§7) on the FS.GG.Rendering host: the `Model`/`Msg` skeleton, the
**fixed 60 Hz accumulator** dispatching constant `Tick (1/60)` with up to 5 catch-up ticks
(§7.5, §7.7, §13), the camera transform, and an empty 1280×720 viewport (§6, §8) that clears
every frame. No world yet — a deterministic, steppable loop with `Ui = Title`.

### M1 — Chunk store, worldgen & streaming
Build the tile substrate (§7.1, §7.2, §13): the `Chunk` flat-array model with the documented
mutable-buffer discipline (only the sim step writes tiles; `Version`/`Dirty` flags; the
`WorldEvent` stream), the deterministic hashed-coordinate worldgen pipeline (heightmap →
strata → caves → ore veins → liquids → decor → spawn, §13) evaluated per tile so any chunk is
reproducible from `Seed`, and camera-driven active-set streaming with async `ChunkGenerated`
(§14.1, §14.13).

### M2 — Platformer physics & tilemap collision
Implement player locomotion (§4.1, §4.2): walk accel/friction, gravity + terminal velocity,
variable-height jump with coyote time and jump buffer, fast-fall, step-up, and the swept
axis-separated AABB-vs-tilemap collision (integrate X then Y, resolve, set grounded) with no
tunneling at terminal velocity (§14.6, §14.7).

### M3 — Mining, tool tiers & drops
Add mining (§4.3): `toolPower × dt` progress per held tick, the tool-tier gate (under-tier =
0 progress + red flash), off-target decay, wall-mining with `Ctrl`, and on-break tile→Air +
chunk `Version` bump + `TileChanged` event. Spawn dropped-item entities with gravity, the
64 px magnet pickup, merge and despawn rules (§4.4, §14.2, §14.3, §14.4).

### M4 — Placement & building
Implement right-click placement (§4.5): the reach/support/no-self-overlap validity rules,
foreground-block vs background-wall layers, stack decrement, and the special placeables
(door/torch/platform/chest/station) with their footprints and interactions (§14.11).

### M5 — Inventory, hotbar & crafting
Wire the inventory model (§7.2 `Inventory`, §9): 10-slot hotbar + 30-slot main, selection via
wheel/digits, drag/split/drop, the `E` inventory+crafting panel, and the recipe table
(§12) — craftable-list gating on inventory + in-range station, input consumption, output
addition, and rejection on insufficient materials (§14.5).

### M6 — Health, hunger & damage
Add survival state (§4.6): max-100 HP with conditional regen, hunger drain and starvation,
fall damage, contact damage with the 0.7 s invuln window and knockback, eating consumables,
and death → configurable inventory drop + respawn at bed/world-spawn after the fade (§4.6
death, §14.9, §14.10, §14.15).

### M7 — Combat
Implement weapons (§4.7): the 90° melee swing arc with capsule hit-test and tier-scaled
damage, the ranged bow/arrow projectile with gravity and despawn-on-hit, and enemy HP,
knockback, and hit-flash.

### M8 — Day/night cycle
Add the time system (§4.8): `DayTime` advance over `dayLengthSeconds` with the Dawn/Day/Dusk/
Night/Pre-dawn phases, `Day`/`DaysSurvived` increment on wrap, ambient sky-light lerp by
phase, and bed-sleep fast-forward to next dawn when no enemies are near.

### M9 — Enemy spawning & AI
Wire the spawner and enemy roster (§4.9, §5): the 1 s spawn cadence gated to night/dark,
off-screen floored columns 240–640 px from the player under the `daysSurvived`-scaled cap,
the per-archetype `Idle→Patrol→Chase→Attack→(Flee|Dead)` state machines (walker/flyer/jumper/
ranged/brute), greedy local pathing, and despawn rules (§14.8).

### M10 — Lighting
Implement the per-tile light field (§4.10, §8.5): sky flood scaled by day phase plus torch/
lava emitters, BFS flood-fill propagation with air/solid attenuation recomputed incrementally
on tile change, driving both the render darkness multiply and spawn eligibility (§4.9). Ships
behind a toggle (flat day-phase ambient when disabled), per the v1/v1.1 note.

### M11 — Rendering, chunk-surface caching & HUD
Complete the back-to-front draw list (§8.1): sky, parallax, wall/foreground tile layers with
auto-tiling and variant hashing, drops, enemies/projectiles, player + tool-swing arc, cursor/
mining-crack overlay, lighting multiply, and particles. Implement the off-screen chunk-surface
cache invalidated on `Version` (§8.2) and the HUD (hearts/hunger/hotbar/clock/minimap, §9).

### M12 — Menus, settings & key rebinding (shared game shell)
Adopt the generic game shell (FS-GG/FS.GG.Rendering#991): main menu (title **Hollowreach** +
Start/Config/Exit), `Esc` pause routing (Resume · Config · Exit to menu), Settings with screen
resolution + fullscreen through the SkiaViewer + `LogicalCanvas` letterbox seam, and in-game
key rebinding of the §3 controls, persisted via `KeymapCodec`. Hollowreach provides its name +
key→command map + play `update`/`view`; the shell provides the rest. No bespoke menu system —
this hosts the §9 Title and Pause screens (the seed/load-slot rows sit over the Start entry).

### M13 — Audio
Wire the SFX checklist (§10): per-material mining hits, tile break/place, pickup chime, craft
clatter, player-hurt grunt, enemy hurt/die, jump/land, eat crunch, inventory flap, low-HP
heartbeat, plus the Day/Night/Cave music loops with 2 s cross-fade on phase/band change. A
shell Config volume row may drive levels.

### M14 — Save/load persistence
Implement the async save/load service (§13): the header + chunk-delta store (only chunks that
differ from the deterministic worldgen baseline, RLE-compressed) with pristine chunks
regenerated from `seed`, snapshot-under-update-thread then compress-off-thread, and the
`load(save(model))` round-trip guarantee for world/player/inventory/time/chests (§14.12).

### M15 — Acceptance & determinism
Land the acceptance harness against all 15 scenarios (§14): worldgen determinism + seed
sensitivity, mining/drops, tool-tier gate, pickup, crafting, tilemap collision, jump/coyote/
buffer, night spawn + day suppression, contact damage/invuln, hunger/starvation, placement
validity, save/load round-trip, chunk streaming, death/respawn, and the fixed-timestep
input-replay **determinism** yielding bit-identical player/inventory/enemy state (§13).
