# Hollowveil

## 1. Overview
**Hollowveil** is a 2D action-exploration platformer set in a single, continuous,
hand-authored subterranean world. The player is a small, agile revenant who awakens
at the bottom of a collapsed cistern with nothing but a worn blade. The core fantasy
is *earned mobility*: every region you cannot reach today becomes reachable tomorrow
because you found a new ability — a double jump, a horizontal dash, a wall-climb, a
grapple hook. The core verb is **move precisely and fight tightly**: tight,
sub-frame-tuned platformer physics make traversal itself feel good, and a compact
melee+ranged combat kit makes encounters readable and skill-based. It is fun because
the world is a lock-and-key puzzle the size of the whole map, and because the running,
jumping, and slashing are crisp enough to be satisfying on their own, second to second.

## 2. Core Game Loop
**Moment-to-moment (combat/traversal loop, ~1–10 s):**
`observe room → move/jump/dash → engage or avoid enemy → attack (melee/ranged) → dodge & i-frame through danger → collect currency/heal → reach next door → repeat`

**Exploration loop (~2–15 min):**
`enter new room → hit an ability gate you cannot pass → note it on the map → explore
elsewhere → defeat a mini-boss or find an ability pickup → backtrack via fast-travel
to the gate → unlock new region → find next gate`

**Session loop (~30–60 min):**
`rest at Save Vein (save + refill + respawn enemies) → push into unexplored zone →
find ability or fight boss → either bank progress at next Save Vein or die → on death,
respawn at last Save Vein and drop a recoverable currency cache at the death site →
return to recover cache → continue`

**Macro loop (full game, ~6–10 h):** acquire all 4 traversal abilities + 2 combat
upgrades, defeat both major bosses, reach the sealed core, win.

## 3. Controls & Input
Keyboard is primary. Gamepad bindings are listed for parity. Input model column states
whether an action reacts to **edge** (the frame the key transitions down/up) or to the
**held** state sampled each tick.

| Action            | Keyboard        | Gamepad            | Input model        | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------|
| Move left/right   | A / D           | Left stick / D-pad | Held (axis -1..1)  | Analog stick clamped to -1/0/+1 in v1 |
| Jump              | Space           | A                  | Edge (press) + held| Edge starts jump; held controls variable height |
| Dash              | L-Shift         | RB                 | Edge (press)       | Buffered; gated by Dash ability |
| Attack (melee)    | J               | X                  | Edge (press)       | Directional via held Up/Down |
| Ranged (Bolt)     | K               | Y                  | Edge (press)       | Consumes mana; gated by Bolt ability |
| Grapple           | L               | LB                 | Edge (press)       | Gated by Grapple ability |
| Look up / crouch  | W / S           | Up / Down          | Held               | Pans camera; crouch shrinks hitbox |
| Interact          | E               | A (contextual)     | Edge (press)       | Save Veins, levers, fast-travel |
| Open Map          | Tab             | Select             | Edge (press)       | Pauses sim; toggles map overlay |
| Pause             | Esc             | Start              | Edge (press)       | Pause menu |

**Input buffering:** Jump and Dash presses are buffered for **6 frames (0.1 s)**.
**Edge detection:** `update` receives discrete `KeyDown`/`KeyUp` messages; the model
holds a `Keys` set and per-action `pressedThisTick` flags cleared at end of each `Tick`.

## 4. Mechanics (detailed)
All constants are given in **logical pixels** and **seconds**. The simulation runs at a
**fixed 60 Hz** step (`dt = 1/60 ≈ 0.0167 s`). The player capsule is **20 × 36 px**
(crouched: 20 × 22 px). "px/s" = pixels per second; "px/s²" = acceleration.

### 4.1 Horizontal movement
- Max run speed: **240 px/s**.
- Ground acceleration: **1800 px/s²** (reaches max in ~0.13 s).
- Ground friction (no input): **2400 px/s²** decel to 0.
- Air acceleration: **1200 px/s²** (looser, retains momentum).
- Air friction (no input): **600 px/s²** (slight, preserves drift).
- Turn-around bonus: when input opposes velocity on ground, apply **2× ground accel**
  for snappy direction changes.

### 4.2 Jump, gravity, and assists
- Gravity (rising): **2000 px/s²**.
- Gravity (falling): **2600 px/s²** (heavier fall = less floaty, classic feel).
- Jump impulse (initial up velocity): **620 px/s** → apex height ≈ **96 px** (~3 tiles).
- Max fall speed (terminal): **900 px/s**.
- **Variable jump height:** while Jump is held and `vy < 0`, rising gravity applies.
  On Jump release while still rising, set `vy = max(vy, -180 px/s)` (cut the jump short).
  Min tap-jump height ≈ **24 px**.
- **Coyote time:** **6 frames (0.1 s)** after leaving a ledge, a ground jump is still
  allowed.
- **Jump buffering:** a Jump press within **6 frames (0.1 s)** before landing triggers a
  jump on the landing frame.
- **Apex hang:** when `|vy| < 60 px/s` near apex, apply gravity at **0.5×** for **2
  frames** to add a brief floaty hang (improves air control).

### 4.3 Wall slide & wall jump (always available)
- Wall contact + horizontal input toward wall + airborne ⇒ **wall slide**: clamp fall
  speed to **120 px/s**.
- **Wall jump:** Jump while wall-sliding ⇒ `vy = -560 px/s`, `vx = ±300 px/s` away
  from wall. For **8 frames (0.13 s)** after a wall jump, horizontal input is at **40%**
  authority (prevents instantly re-hugging the wall — enforces arc).

### 4.4 Dash (ability-gated)
- Distance: **140 px** over **0.18 s** (≈ **780 px/s** constant horizontal velocity).
- During dash: gravity is **disabled**, `vy` forced to 0 (flat dash).
- **I-frames during dash:** first **10 frames (0.167 s)** grant invulnerability.
- Cooldown: **0.35 s** after dash ends before a new ground dash. **Air dash:** one per
  airborne period; refreshed on landing or wall touch.
- Dash cancels: landing, wall contact, or hitstun ends a dash early.

### 4.5 Grapple (ability-gated)
- Fires a hook **up to 320 px** in the aim direction (8-way; defaults to facing+up).
- On hitting a **Grapple Node** (designated anchor tiles), the player is reeled at
  **600 px/s** toward the node, then released into a momentum-preserving arc.
- If it hits a grappleable enemy, pulls the player toward it (gap-close).
- Cooldown: **0.25 s**. Max one active hook.

### 4.6 Combat — melee
- Melee swing: hitbox **34 × 28 px** in front of player (or above/below if Up/Down
  held), active for **6 frames (0.1 s)**, startup **3 frames**, recovery **7 frames**.
- Base damage: **10**. Combo: 3rd consecutive hit within 0.6 s deals **15**.
- **Hitstop:** on a successful hit, freeze both attacker and target for **3 frames** for
  impact feel.
- **Pogo:** a Down-melee that connects with an enemy/hazard bounces the player up
  (`vy = -520 px/s`) and refreshes air dash. Core traversal tech.
- Knockback to enemy: **160 px/s** away from player, decaying over 0.2 s.

### 4.7 Combat — ranged (Bolt)
- Bolt projectile: **8 × 8 px**, speed **520 px/s**, lifetime **1.2 s** or until
  collision. Damage **8**. Costs **1 mana** (see 4.9).
- Max 4 bolts live simultaneously (cap).
- Bolts pass through terrain? No — destroyed on solid tile. Pass through hazards: no.

### 4.8 Damage, i-frames, hitstun (player)
- On taking damage: lose HP, enter **hitstun** for **8 frames (0.133 s)** (input locked
  except cancel into dash if Dash owned and off cooldown), apply knockback
  **200 px/s** away from source + small upward pop **-120 px/s**.
- **Invulnerability frames after being hit:** **60 frames (1.0 s)**; player sprite
  flashes at 12 Hz. Damage and contact are ignored during i-frames.
- Dash i-frames (4.4) and hit-i-frames are tracked as a single `invulnUntil` timer
  (whichever is later wins).

### 4.9 Health & Mana
- **Health:** starts at **50 HP**, shown as 5 masks × 10 HP. +1 mask (max **+5**) per
  **Vessel Shard** (4 shards = 1 mask). Cap **100 HP** at full upgrade.
- **Mana (Veil):** pool of **100**, regenerates **8/s** out of combat (no damage dealt
  or taken for 1.5 s), **0/s** in combat. Melee hit grants **+6 mana** on connect
  (encourages aggression). Bolt costs ~ see 4.7 (1 mana = 1 unit; bolt = 12 mana).
- **Focus heal:** hold Interact (E) while grounded and still for **0.8 s** to spend
  **33 mana** and heal **10 HP (one mask)**. Interrupted by damage or movement.

### 4.10 Currency & upgrades
- Currency: **Embers**, dropped by enemies (2–25 each) and found in caches.
- **Death cache:** on death, all carried Embers spawn as a recoverable **Shade**
  marker at the death location; touching it returns the Embers. Dying again before
  recovery destroys the previous Shade (only one exists).
- Spend Embers at **Vendor (the Tinker)** rooms on: extra mask (Vessel Shards are found,
  but masks assembled here), Bolt damage +, dash cooldown -, map markers, etc.

### 4.11 Ability gates (lock-and-key)
Each traversal ability is the key to a class of obstacle:
- **Double Jump** → clears **128 px** vertical gaps / high ledges.
- **Dash** → crosses **140 px** horizontal pits & dash-only narrow gaps; breaks
  **dash-crystal** barriers.
- **Wall-Climb** (upgrades wall slide into climb at **180 px/s** up) → ascends tall
  shafts with no footholds.
- **Grapple** → traverses grapple-node chasms and ceilings; pulls heavy levers.
Gates are authored as tile/region metadata: a room edge is `Locked(ability)` until the
ability is owned. The map records locked edges so the player can plan backtracks.

## 5. Entities / Game Objects
Every entity is a discriminated-union variant in a flat `Entity` array per active room
(see §7). Sizes in px, HP, speeds in px/s.

### 5.1 Player
- Size 20×36, HP 50–100, see §4 for all behavior.
- State machine: `Idle | Running | Jumping | Falling | WallSlide | Dashing |
  AttackingMelee | FiringBolt | Grappling | Hitstun | Focusing | Dead`.

### 5.2 Enemy roster
| Name        | Size (px) | HP  | Move (px/s) | Damage | Behavior / state machine | Drop (Embers) |
|-------------|-----------|-----|-------------|--------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Crawler     | 24×16     | 15  | 60          | 5      | Patrol ledge, turn at edge/wall; no aggro | 2–4 |
| Lunger      | 28×28     | 25  | 0 / 360 dash| 10     | Idle → telegraph 0.4 s → lunge 0.25 s → recover 0.6 s | 5–8 |
| Floater     | 22×22     | 12  | 80 (hover)  | 6      | Sine bob, drifts toward player; pops into 3 bolts on death | 4–6 |
| Slinger     | 26×30     | 20  | 40          | 7 (proj)| Keep distance; fire 200 px/s arc shot every 1.5 s | 6–10 |
| Sentinel    | 36×40     | 60  | 90          | 12     | Shielded front (melee blocked); flank or pogo to hit; charges | 12–18 |
| Spore Pod   | 20×20     | 1   | 0           | 8      | Stationary; bursts into damaging cloud (radius 40 px, 0.5 s) | 0 |
| Wraith      | 26×34     | 35  | 140         | 9      | Phases through walls toward player; tangible only 1 s windows | 10–15 |

Enemy AI types (referenced above):
- **Patroller** (Crawler): waypoint/edge-bounded walk, no player awareness.
- **Ambusher** (Lunger): proximity trigger (aggro radius **160 px**) → telegraph →
  commit → recover. Cannot turn mid-lunge.
- **Drifter** (Floater): steers velocity toward player at capped accel; ignores terrain.
- **Ranger** (Slinger): maintains **standoff distance 180–260 px**; strafes; shoots.
- **Bruiser** (Sentinel): directional defense + charge attack on **240 px** line of
  sight; vulnerable from behind/above.

### 5.3 Hazards & interactables
- **Spike tile:** 16×16, deals **15** + knockback, respawns player at last safe ground
  if it would kill (no instant-death insta-loss; HP loss only).
- **Save Vein:** interactable; saves game, refills HP/mana, sets respawn point, respawns
  room enemies.
- **Lever / Gate door:** toggled by Interact or by hitting with melee/bolt.
- **Grapple Node:** anchor for grapple.
- **Ability Pickup:** floating relic; on touch, grants ability + plays acquire sequence.
- **Vessel Shard / Ember Cache:** pickups.

### 5.4 F#-flavored type sketch
```fsharp
type AbilityId = DoubleJump | Dash | WallClimb | Grapple | Bolt

type EnemyKind = Crawler | Lunger | Floater | Slinger | Sentinel | SporePod | Wraith

type EnemyAi =
    | Patroller of leftBound: float * rightBound: float * dir: int
    | Ambusher  of aggroR: float * phase: AmbushPhase
    | Drifter   of accel: float
    | Ranger    of minD: float * maxD: float * cooldown: float
    | Bruiser   of charging: bool

type Entity =
    | EnemyE of Enemy
    | ProjectileE of Projectile      // bolts, slinger shots
    | PickupE of Pickup
    | HazardE of Hazard
    | ShadeE of embers: int          // death cache

and Enemy =
    { Kind: EnemyKind; Ai: EnemyAi; Pos: Vec2; Vel: Vec2
      Hp: int; FacingRight: bool; HitFlashUntil: float; State: EnemyState }
```

## 6. World / Levels / Progression
- Logical resolution **1280×720**. **Tile size 16×16 px**. A room is a tilemap of
  W×H tiles; camera shows ~80×45 tiles at 1:1 (rooms may be larger and scroll).
- **World structure:** one interconnected world of **6 zones**, ~**40 rooms** total,
  joined by door edges. The world graph is authored; zones gate by ability.

| Zone | Theme | Entry gate | Key content |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Z1 Cistern | tutorial caves | none (start) | basic platforming, Crawlers, first Save Vein |
| Z2 Hollow Roots | vertical shafts | none | **Double Jump** pickup, Lungers |
| Z3 Ashen Galleries | wide horizontal | Double Jump | **Dash** pickup, Slingers, **Boss A: The Warden** |
| Z4 Weeping Climb | tall wet walls | Dash | **Wall-Climb** pickup, Wraiths |
| Z5 Spindle Reach | open chasms | Wall-Climb | **Grapple** pickup, Sentinels |
| Z6 The Sealed Core | finale | Grapple | **Boss B: Veil Echo**, ending |

- **Difficulty ramp:** enemy HP and density rise zone to zone; later zones combine AI
  types (e.g. Slinger + Sentinel rooms). Backtracking with new abilities makes early
  zones trivial (intended power-fantasy payoff) but adds optional hard rooms behind
  late gates inside early zones.
- **Fast-travel:** designated **Vein Gates** (a subset of Save Veins, one per zone)
  form a fast-travel network unlocked as each is visited; map menu lets you warp
  between any visited Vein Gates.

## 7. State Model (Elmish/MVU)
The state is **layered**: a top `Model` composes `World`, the active `Room`, the
`Player`, and per-room `Entities`. Persistent progress (`Save`) is separated from
transient per-room simulation so saving = serialize `Save`, and entering a room =
rebuild transient state from authored room data + `Save` flags.

### 7.1 Model (record sketch)
```fsharp
type Mode = Title | Playing | Paused | MapOverlay | GameOver | Win

type Save =
    { Abilities: Set<AbilityId>
      MaxHp: int; Embers: int
      VesselShards: int
      VisitedRooms: Set<RoomId>
      VisitedVeinGates: Set<RoomId>
      OpenedDoors: Set<DoorId>           // levers/gates already toggled
      DefeatedBosses: Set<BossId>
      CollectedPickups: Set<PickupId>    // so they don't respawn
      RespawnRoom: RoomId; RespawnPos: Vec2
      Shade: (RoomId * Vec2 * int) option }   // death cache

type Player =
    { Pos: Vec2; Vel: Vec2; FacingRight: bool
      Hp: int; Mana: float
      State: PlayerState
      Grounded: bool; OnWall: WallSide option
      CoyoteTimer: float; JumpBufferTimer: float
      InvulnUntil: float; DashCooldownUntil: float; AirDashAvailable: bool
      JumpHeld: bool }

type Room =
    { Id: RoomId; Tiles: TileLayer; Width: int; Height: int
      Doors: Door list; SpawnTable: EnemySpawn list
      GrappleNodes: Vec2 list; Hazards: Hazard list }

type Camera = { Pos: Vec2; Mode: CameraMode; Shake: float }

type Model =
    { Mode: Mode
      Save: Save                         // persistent
      Room: Room                         // active authored room data
      Player: Player
      Entities: Entity[]                 // transient per-room sim
      Camera: Camera
      Keys: Set<Key>; Pressed: Set<Action>   // input
      Time: float                        // accumulated sim seconds
      Boss: BossState option
      Rng: RngState }                    // seeded
```

### 7.2 Msg (DU)
```fsharp
type Msg =
    | Tick of dt: float                  // fixed 1/60 from subscription
    | KeyDown of Key | KeyUp of Key
    | InteractPressed
    | EnterRoom of RoomId * fromDoor: DoorId
    | AbilityAcquired of AbilityId
    | SaveAtVein of RoomId
    | FastTravel of RoomId
    | PlayerDied
    | BossPhaseChanged of BossId * int
    | ToggleMap | TogglePause
    | NewGame | LoadGame | QuitToTitle
```

### 7.3 update (key transitions)
- `Tick dt` (the workhorse): advances the **fixed-step simulation** in order:
  1. fold buffered input into player intent; decay timers (coyote, buffer, invuln).
  2. integrate player physics (§4): accel, gravity, variable jump, wall logic, dash.
  3. resolve player↔tile collision (swept AABB, axis-separated X then Y).
  4. step every entity AI (§5.2) and integrate enemy/projectile motion.
  5. resolve combat: melee/bolt hitboxes vs enemies; enemy/hazard vs player + i-frames.
  6. process pickups, doors, Save Veins, death-cache touch.
  7. detect room-edge crossing → emit `EnterRoom`; detect death → `PlayerDied`.
  8. step boss FSM, possibly emit `BossPhaseChanged`.
  9. update camera (room-lock clamp + smooth follow + shake decay).
- `KeyDown/KeyUp`: update `Keys`; set `Pressed` for edge actions (with buffer timers).
- `EnterRoom`: load authored room, spawn enemies from `SpawnTable` minus
  `CollectedPickups`/defeated, place player at the destination door, reset transient.
- `AbilityAcquired`: add to `Save.Abilities`; this immediately re-evaluates gate edges.
- `SaveAtVein`: write `Save` to persistence, refill HP/mana, set respawn, respawn room.
- `PlayerDied`: stash `Shade`, reset player at `RespawnRoom/Pos`, restore from `Save`.
- `BossPhaseChanged`: swap boss attack pattern set (see §11/boss specs).

### 7.4 view (pure)
`view` is a **pure** projection from `Model` to a render-command list (no mutation, no
drawing). It emits ordered draw commands (§8) that the Skia host executes. It reads
`Camera` to offset world-space, `Player.State`/timers for sprite frame + flash, and
`Mode` to overlay HUD/map/pause. No game logic lives in `view`.

### 7.5 Subscriptions
- **Tick subscription:** a 60 FPS loop. To keep simulation deterministic, the
  subscription uses a **fixed-timestep accumulator**: real frame `Δ` accrues; while
  `acc ≥ 1/60`, dispatch `Tick (1/60)` and subtract. Render once per real frame. This
  decouples render rate from sim rate.
- **Input subscription:** OS keyboard events → `KeyDown`/`KeyUp`.

### 7.6 MVU scaling: the real-time tradeoff (important)
A Metroidvania is a heavy real-time sim: ~30–60 entities, swept collision, boss FSMs,
all at 60 Hz. Pushing **all** of that through a strictly pure, allocation-per-frame
`update : Msg -> Model -> Model * Cmd` is the main architectural risk.

Recommended approach — **keep MVU at the boundary, isolate the hot loop:**
- MVU owns **discrete, eventful state**: mode transitions, room loads, ability
  acquisition, saving, fast-travel, boss phase changes, menus. These are infrequent and
  benefit hugely from MVU's predictable, replayable, testable transitions.
- The **per-tick simulation** (physics + collision + AI for the current room) is
  implemented as a single, self-contained pure step function
  `simulate : float -> SimState -> SimState` operating on the transient layer
  (`Player`, `Entities`, `Camera`). It is *called from* the `Tick` case of `update`.
  Internally it may use **mutable local arrays / structs / `Span`** for collision and
  integration to avoid per-frame GC pressure — this mutation is local and does not
  escape, so `update` remains referentially transparent from the outside (same inputs →
  same `Model`).
- This preserves the MVU contract (deterministic, testable `update`; pure `view`) while
  acknowledging that **strict immutability for 60 entities × 60 Hz is a performance
  trap**. The boundary is: *persistent + discrete = idiomatic MVU; transient + hot =
  optimized pure step with internal mutation.*
- Determinism is retained by threading a seeded `Rng` through `simulate` and using the
  fixed timestep (§7.5), so runs are reproducible for tests (§14).

Tradeoff summary: we sacrifice "everything is an immutable Model diff" purity in the
inner loop for frame-budget safety, but we *gain it back* at the boundary where MVU's
strengths (debuggability, save/replay, testable transitions) actually matter.

## 8. Rendering (Skia 2D)
Coordinate system: world-space in logical px, Y-down. Camera transform = translate by
`-Camera.Pos` then clamp. Logical canvas **1280×720**, letterboxed to window.

**Draw order (back to front):**
1. **Parallax background** (2 layers, scroll at 0.3× and 0.6× camera; zone-tinted).
2. **Tilemap — back décor layer** (non-colliding ornament tiles).
3. **Tilemap — solid layer** (collision tiles; batched via Skia drawAtlas from one
   tile texture).
4. **Hazards** (spikes #C0392B, spore clouds semi-transparent #7FB069 @ 40% alpha).
5. **Pickups / Save Veins** (Save Vein glow #4EC9B0, pulsing).
6. **Enemies** (per-kind sprite; hit-flash = draw white-tinted for 3 frames).
7. **Player** (sprite; during i-frames flash alpha 30%↔100% @ 12 Hz; dash = motion
   streak using 3 trailing ghosts at decreasing alpha).
8. **Projectiles** (bolts #F4D35E with 6 px glow; slinger shots #E07A5F).
9. **Particles** (hit sparks, ember pickups, dust on land — pooled, max 200).
10. **Foreground tilemap** (occluding tiles drawn over player, e.g. grass tufts).
11. **HUD** (§9) in screen-space (no camera transform).
12. **Overlays** (map/pause/title) when `Mode` requires.

**Palette:** background #1A1A2E base; per-zone tint (Z1 #16213E, Z3 #3A2618,
Z4 #14323B, Z6 #2B0B1E). Player #E0E1DD. Tiles #495867 / outline #2F3A45.
**Fonts:** UI "JetBrains Mono" / fallback monospace, 16 px HUD, 28 px headers.
**Camera:** see §9.2 — room-locked clamp + smoothed follow; **screen shake** on boss
hits & landings (decaying offset, max 8 px).
**Redraw strategy:** full redraw every render frame (60 FPS) — Skia clears and repaints;
tile layers batched via `drawAtlas`. No dirty-rect in v1 (full clear is cheap at 720p).

## 9. UI / HUD / Screens

### 9.1 Screens
- **Title:** game logo, "New Game / Continue / Quit", animated background.
- **Playing:** HUD (below) + world.
- **Paused:** dimmed world (50% black overlay), menu (Resume / Map / Options / Quit).
- **Map overlay (Tab):** the persistent **world map** — explored rooms drawn as
  connected cells; current room highlighted; icons for Save Veins, Vein Gates (fast
  travel), bosses, **locked gates color-coded by required ability**, uncollected
  pickups (if "map markers" upgrade bought). Selecting a visited Vein Gate fast-travels.
- **Game Over:** "You fell" + Embers lost location hint + Respawn.
- **Win:** ending card + run stats (time, % map explored, deaths).

### 9.2 Camera detail
- **Room-locked:** camera clamps to current room bounds; in small rooms the room is
  centered (no scroll). Default mode.
- **Smooth follow:** in rooms larger than the viewport, camera lerps toward player at
  smoothing factor **0.12/frame** with a **48 px dead-zone box** around the player so
  small movements don't jiggle the view; look-up/crouch pans **±80 px** vertically.

## 11. Win / Loss / Scoring
- **Win condition:** defeat **Boss B (Veil Echo)** in Z6 and touch the core relic →
  Win screen. Requires all 4 traversal abilities to have reached Z6.
- **Loss condition (death):** HP reaches 0 → `PlayerDied`. Not a hard game-over: respawn
  at last Save Vein, drop recoverable Shade (§4.10). **Game Over screen** only appears
  flavor-wise on death; the run continues. There are no limited lives/continues.
- **Scoring (run stats, not points-based):** tracked for the Win card —
  `completionTime`, `mapExploredPercent = visitedRooms / totalRooms`, `deathCount`,
  `bossesDefeated`, `embersBanked`. No arcade score; "best time" persists per save slot.
- **Boss A — The Warden (Z3 gate boss):** HP **300**. A heavy armored sentinel.
  - **Phase 1 (100%–66% HP):** ground charges across arena (speed 300 px/s, telegraph
    0.5 s), overhead slam creating a shockwave (jump or dash through). Weak point:
    back/head (pogo). Punish window after slam recovery (0.8 s).
  - **Phase 2 (66%–33%):** adds 200 px/s arc projectiles (3-shot fan) between charges;
    charge speed → 380 px/s; arena spikes rise on edges.
  - **Phase 3 (<33%):** enraged — double charge, slam now spawns 2 Spore Pods; faster
    recovery (0.5 s windows). Transition at each threshold triggers `BossPhaseChanged`,
    a 1 s invulnerable roar, and screen shake.
- **Boss B — Veil Echo (Z6 final):** HP **480**. A mirror-revenant that uses the
  player's own abilities.
  - **Phase 1 (100%–70%):** dashes (matching player dash 780 px/s with i-frames you must
    bait out), melee combos; teleports to opposite side every 4 s.
  - **Phase 2 (70%–40%):** adds grapple-pulls (yanks player toward hazards) and bolt
    volleys (5 bolts, 520 px/s, fan); spawns Wraith adds (max 2).
  - **Phase 3 (<40%):** "Veil collapse" — arena darkens, only lit near player; Echo
    chains double-jump + air-dash strings; rapid teleports; must use pogo on its
    descending slam to reach its exposed core. Phase transitions at 70%/40% via
    `BossPhaseChanged`, 1.2 s invuln, full arena flash.

## 12. Difficulty & Balancing
Data-driven tunables (a config record loaded at startup; designers edit these):

| Parameter            | Default | Range      | Effect |

| bossAEnrageThreshold | 0.33    | 0.2–0.5    | Warden phase-3 HP fraction |

Optional difficulty modes scale `enemyDamageMult` / `hitIFrames`: Story (0.5 / 90),
Normal (1.0 / 60), Veteran (1.5 / 40).

## 13. Technical Notes
- **Performance budget:** target **60 FPS / 16.7 ms/frame**. Per room: ≤ **40
  simultaneous entities**, ≤ **40 live projectiles**, ≤ **200 particles**. Tilemap
  batched in one `drawAtlas` call per layer. Sim step budget ≤ **4 ms**, render ≤
  **8 ms**, slack **4 ms**.
- **Fixed vs variable timestep:** simulation is **fixed at 1/60 s** via the accumulator
  (§7.5); rendering is variable (once per real frame). Optional render interpolation
  between the two latest sim states (lerp positions by `acc / (1/60)`) for smoothness on
  high-refresh displays — off in v1.
- **Determinism / RNG:** a single seeded PRNG (`RngState`, e.g. xoshiro) threaded
  through `simulate`. Seed stored in `Save` for reproducibility. No use of wall-clock or
  unordered collections in sim. This makes acceptance tests (§14) reproducible.
- **Collision:** swept AABB, axis-separated (resolve X then Y) against the solid tile
  layer; broadphase = tile grid query of cells overlapping the swept bounds. One-way
  platforms supported via Y-only-down collision flag.
- **Persistence:** `Save` serialized to JSON (one file per slot, 3 slots). Atomic write
  (temp file + rename). Saving only at Save Veins. Settings/keybinds stored separately.
- **Edge cases:** (a) crossing a room edge mid-dash — finish dash, then load room;
  (b) two enemies overlapping player on same frame — apply highest damage only, single
  i-frame trigger; (c) grapple node destroyed/out of range — hook misses, no reel;
  (d) save during boss — disallowed (no Save Vein in boss arena); (e) pogo on dying
  enemy — still grants bounce if the hit connected that frame; (f) focus-heal with
  insufficient mana — no-op, no animation.

## 14. Acceptance Criteria (test scenarios)
All scenarios run the deterministic fixed-step sim (seed fixed). "frame" = 1/60 s.

1. **Run acceleration reaches cap.**
   GIVEN the player is idle and grounded on flat ground,
   WHEN the player holds Right for 12 frames (0.2 s),
   THEN `Player.Vel.X` equals **240 px/s** (±1) and does not exceed it.

2. **Variable jump height — tap vs hold.**
   GIVEN the player is grounded,
   WHEN the player presses Jump and releases it after 1 frame (tap),
   THEN peak height is ≤ **30 px**;
   AND WHEN instead the player holds Jump through the rise,
   THEN peak height is **≥ 90 px** (≈96).

3. **Coyote time allows a late jump.**
   GIVEN the player walks off a ledge and is now airborne,
   WHEN the player presses Jump within **6 frames** of leaving the ledge,
   THEN a full ground jump executes (`Vel.Y == -620`);
   AND WHEN the press is on frame **7**, THEN no jump occurs.

4. **Jump buffering triggers on landing.**
   GIVEN the player is falling toward ground,
   WHEN Jump is pressed **5 frames** before the landing frame,
   THEN on the landing frame the player jumps automatically (`Vel.Y == -620`).

5. **Ability gate blocks then unlocks.**
   GIVEN the player lacks **Dash** and a room edge is `Locked(Dash)` across a 140 px pit,
   WHEN the player attempts to cross, THEN the edge does not transition and the player
   cannot reach the far side (falls/blocked);
   AND WHEN `AbilityAcquired Dash` is dispatched and the player dashes across,
   THEN `EnterRoom` for the far room is emitted.

6. **Dash i-frames negate damage.**
   GIVEN the player dashes through a Crawler on frame 0 of the dash,
   WHEN contact occurs within the first **10 frames** of the dash,
   THEN `Player.Hp` is unchanged and no hitstun is entered;
   AND WHEN contact occurs on frame **11**, THEN the player takes damage.

7. **Post-hit invulnerability window.**
   GIVEN the player takes a hit at time T and `hitIFrames = 60`,
   WHEN a second enemy contacts the player at T + 0.5 s (frame 30),
   THEN no additional HP is lost (still invulnerable);
   AND WHEN contact occurs at T + 1.05 s (frame 63), THEN HP is lost again.

8. **Melee deals damage and combo scales.**
   GIVEN a Lunger at 25 HP in melee range,
   WHEN the player lands 3 melee hits within 0.6 s,
   THEN damage dealt is 10 + 10 + 15 = **35** and the Lunger is dead (HP ≤ 0).

9. **Pogo bounce and air-dash refresh.**
   GIVEN the player is airborne above a Spore Pod with air-dash already used,
   WHEN the player performs a Down-melee that connects,
   THEN `Player.Vel.Y == -520` (bounce) AND `AirDashAvailable == true`.

10. **Save / load round-trip.**
    GIVEN the player interacts with a Save Vein with Embers=1240, MaxHp=70, Dash owned,
    WHEN the game is saved, the process is restarted, and the slot is loaded,
    THEN `Save.Embers == 1240`, `Save.MaxHp == 70`, `Dash ∈ Save.Abilities`,
    AND the player spawns at the Save Vein's room/position with full HP/mana.

11. **Death drops a recoverable Shade.**
    GIVEN the player has 50 Embers and dies in room R at position P,
    WHEN respawn occurs, THEN `Save.Shade == Some(R, P, 50)`, carried Embers = 0,
    and the player is at the last Save Vein;
    AND WHEN the player returns and touches the Shade, THEN Embers = 50 and Shade = None.

12. **Boss A phase transition at threshold.**
    GIVEN Boss A (Warden) at 67% HP in Phase 1,
    WHEN damage brings it to **66%** HP,
    THEN `BossPhaseChanged(Warden, 2)` is emitted, the boss is invulnerable for **60
    frames (1.0 s)**, and afterward arc projectiles are enabled (Phase 2 pattern set).

13. **Camera room-lock clamp.**
    GIVEN a room smaller than the viewport,
    WHEN the player moves to the room's left edge,
    THEN `Camera.Pos.X` does not go below the room's min bound (no out-of-room void
    shown).

14. **Fixed-timestep determinism.**
    GIVEN the same seed and the same recorded input sequence,
    WHEN the sim is run twice,
    THEN both runs produce identical `Player.Pos` and `Entities` state at every frame
    (bit-identical), regardless of real frame rate.

15. **Input edge vs held (dash is edge-triggered).**
    GIVEN the player holds Dash (Shift) continuously,
    WHEN 60 frames pass,
    THEN exactly **one** dash fires (on the press edge), not a dash every frame;
    AND a second dash only fires after the **0.35 s** cooldown AND a new press edge.

## 15. Stretch Goals
Ranked, out of scope for v1:
1. **Charm/relic system:** equippable modifiers (trade health for damage, auto-Shade
   recovery) with limited slots — adds build variety.
2. **Render interpolation** between sim states for buttergi smoothness on 120/144 Hz.
3. **Map annotations & custom markers** the player can place.
4. **More abilities:** super-dash (shinespark), down-slam, charged bolt.
5. **Boss rush mode** unlocked after the ending.
6. **A third optional super-boss** behind a fully-explored-map gate.
7. **Speedrun timer + ghost replays** (leverages deterministic sim).
8. **Controller rumble + dynamic music layers** that intensify in combat.
9. **New Game+** with remixed enemy placements and a damage modifier.
10. **Lore tablets** and an in-game bestiary populated by kills.

## Menu & configuration — the shared game shell

Hollowveil uses the **generic FS.GG game shell** (FS-GG/FS.GG.Rendering#991) — the same
menu/start screen and settings every FS.GG game shares — rather than a bespoke per-game
menu. Hollowveil supplies only its **name**, its **key→command map** (the rebindable actions
from §3 Controls), and its play `update`/`view`; the shell provides everything below.

- **Main menu / start screen** — the game's name (**Hollowveil**) as the title label, with
  **Start**, **Config**, and **Exit**. This supersedes the bespoke Title-screen
  "New Game / Continue / Quit" launch affordance of §9.1 (save-slot selection remains a
  game-specific step reached from Start / Continue).
- **`Esc` from gameplay** opens the pause menu (Resume · Config · Exit to menu) over the
  same shell; `Esc` again resumes. This is the shell home for the §3 `Esc` pause action and
  the §9.1 Paused menu; the game's own **Map overlay** (`Tab`, §9.1) and contextual prompts
  remain game-specific and sit alongside the shell.
- **Config / Settings**, all applied live and persisted across restarts:
  - **Screen resolution** and **fullscreen** (windowed / borderless / fullscreen), driven
    through the SkiaViewer window-behavior + `LogicalCanvas` letterbox seam — the same seam
    that letterboxes the logical 1280×720 world view (§6, §8) to the window.
  - **Key rebinding** — the player remaps Hollowveil's controls (the §3 actions: move,
    jump, dash, melee, bolt, grapple, look/crouch, interact, map, pause) via the
    `Controls.KeyRebind` UI over the `KeyboardInput.Keymap` mechanism; bindings persist via
    `KeymapCodec` (JSON), stored separately from the save slots (§13, "settings/keybinds
    stored separately").
  - (Game-specific rows such as the difficulty modes of §12 or volume may be added as extra
    Config rows, but the menu, Esc routing, display settings, and rebind screen come from the
    shell.)

The shell is pointer- and keyboard-navigable over the interactive Controls host (the
`fs-gg-skiaviewer` "game → pointer host" recipe). It is a shared dependency, so Hollowveil
does **not** re-specify menu-stack/cursor/settings machinery of its own.

## 16. Milestone Roadmap

Delivery is milestone-sequenced (M0..Mn), each a small, demonstrable slice grounded in the
sections above. Earlier milestones stand up the deterministic simulation core and the
traversal kit; later ones layer content, the shared shell, audio, and the acceptance
harness. This is a complex spec, so the mechanics of §4 are unpacked one milestone at a time.

### M0 — Scaffold, fixed-step loop & MVU boundary
Stand up the layered Elmish/MVU app (§7) on the FS.GG.Rendering host: the `Model`/`Msg`
skeleton with the persistent `Save` vs. transient sim separation, the fixed-timestep 60 Hz
accumulator subscription (§7.5, §13), and the §7.6 boundary — MVU owns discrete/eventful
state while a self-contained pure `simulate` step (internal local mutation allowed) runs the
hot loop. Empty 1280×720 letterboxed canvas (§6, §8) at `Mode = Title`.

### M1 — Horizontal movement & tile collision
Implement the player capsule (§4.1, §5.1) on a solid tilemap (§6): max run 240 px/s, ground
vs. air acceleration/friction, the turn-around bonus, and swept axis-separated AABB collision
(resolve X then Y) against the solid layer with a tile-grid broadphase (§13). The player runs
and stops crisply against walls and floors.

### M2 — Jump, gravity & assists
Add the full jump feel (§4.2): split rise/fall gravity, the 620 px/s impulse, variable jump
height (cut to `-180` on early release), terminal fall clamp, coyote time (6 frames), jump
buffering (6 frames), and apex hang. Grounded/airborne state and the coyote/buffer timers
(§7.1) drive it.

### M3 — Wall slide & wall jump
Implement always-available wall tech (§4.3): wall-slide fall clamp to 120 px/s on
wall-contact + toward-wall input while airborne, and the wall jump (`vy = -560`, `vx = ±300`
away) with the 8-frame 40%-authority window that enforces the arc.

### M4 — Dash & i-frames
Add the ability-gated dash (§4.4): 140 px over 0.18 s flat (gravity off, `vy = 0`), the
first-10-frame invulnerability folded into the shared `invulnUntil` timer, the 0.35 s
cooldown, the one-per-airborne air dash refreshed on land/wall, edge-triggered + buffered,
and dash cancels on land/wall/hitstun.

### M5 — Grapple
Implement the ability-gated grapple (§4.5): a hook up to 320 px in the aim direction,
reel toward a Grapple Node at 600 px/s released into a momentum-preserving arc, enemy
gap-close pulls, the 0.25 s cooldown, and one active hook.

### M6 — Melee combat & pogo
Add the melee kit (§4.6): the directional 34×28 hitbox with startup/active/recovery frames,
base 10 damage with the 3rd-hit-15 combo window, 3-frame hitstop on connect, enemy
knockback, and the **pogo** — a connecting Down-melee bounces the player (`vy = -520`) and
refreshes the air dash (core traversal tech).

### M7 — Ranged Bolt & mana
Implement the ranged Bolt (§4.7) and the mana economy (§4.9): 8×8 projectiles at 520 px/s
with 1.2 s lifetime, destroyed on solid tiles, capped at 4 live, costing mana; the 100-pool
Veil with 8/s out-of-combat regen (0 in combat), +6 mana per melee connect, and the
`AbilityId.Bolt` gate.

### M8 — Damage, i-frames, health & focus heal
Add the player damage model (§4.8, §4.9): HP masks, hitstun (8 frames, input-locked except
dash-cancel), knockback + upward pop, the 60-frame post-hit invulnerability flashing at
12 Hz merged into `invulnUntil`, and the Focus heal (hold Interact 0.8 s grounded, spend
33 mana for 10 HP, interrupted by damage/movement).

### M9 — Enemies & AI roster
Build the enemy roster and AI types (§5.2): Crawler (Patroller), Lunger (Ambusher with
telegraph/lunge/recover), Floater (Drifter, death-burst bolts), Slinger (Ranger standoff +
arc shots), Sentinel (Bruiser, shielded front + charge), Spore Pod, and Wraith (phasing).
Combat resolution wires melee/bolt hitboxes vs. enemies and enemy/hazard vs. player.

### M10 — Rooms, world graph, ability gates & fast-travel
Implement the interconnected world (§6, §7.3): authored rooms loaded on `EnterRoom` (spawn
from `SpawnTable` minus collected/defeated, place at destination door), the 6-zone graph,
`Locked(ability)` edges re-evaluated on `AbilityAcquired` (§4.11), the Ability Pickup
acquire sequence, and the Vein-Gate fast-travel network unlocked as gates are visited.

### M11 — Currency, death cache, Save Veins & persistence
Add the run economy and persistence (§4.10, §5.3, §13): Embers dropped by enemies and in
caches, the single recoverable **Shade** death-cache, the Tinker vendor upgrades, Save Veins
(save + refill + respawn point + room-enemy respawn), and the atomic JSON `Save`
serialization across 3 slots with the load round-trip.

### M12 — Bosses
Implement the two major bosses (§11): **Boss A — The Warden** (300 HP, 3 phases: charges,
slam shockwave, arc fans, spore adds, enrage) and **Boss B — Veil Echo** (480 HP, 3 phases:
mirror dashes with i-frames, grapple-pulls + bolt volleys + Wraith adds, the "Veil collapse"
darkened arena), each threshold emitting `BossPhaseChanged` with an invulnerable roar and
screen shake, and the win-on-Echo condition.

### M13 — Rendering, HUD & map overlay
Complete the back-to-front draw list (§8): parallax backgrounds, batched `drawAtlas` tile
layers (back/solid/foreground), hazards, pickups/Save Vein glow, per-kind enemies with
hit-flash, the player with i-frame flash and dash ghosts, glowing projectiles, pooled
particles, screen shake, and the HUD (health masks, Veil bar, Ember count, prompts). Render
the §9.1 world **Map overlay** (explored rooms, icons, ability-color-coded locked gates,
fast-travel selection) and the Game Over / Win cards.

### M14 — Menus, settings & key rebinding (shared game shell)
Adopt the generic game shell (FS-GG/FS.GG.Rendering#991): main menu (title **Hollowveil** +
Start/Config/Exit), `Esc` pause routing (Resume · Config · Exit to menu), Settings with
screen resolution + fullscreen through the SkiaViewer + `LogicalCanvas` letterbox seam, and
in-game key rebinding of the §3 controls (move, jump, dash, melee, bolt, grapple,
look/crouch, interact, map, pause), persisted via `KeymapCodec` separately from save slots.
Hollowveil provides its name + key→command map + play `update`/`view`; the shell provides the
rest. No bespoke menu system — this replaces the ad-hoc Title/Pause launch affordances of
§9.1 while the game-specific Map overlay and difficulty modes remain as game rows.

### M15 — Audio
Wire the SFX checklist (§10): jump/double-jump/land, dash/wall-slide/grapple, melee
swing/hit (+hitstop)/pogo, bolt fire/impact, hurt/death, enemy death and Sentinel block,
ember pickup and ability-acquire fanfare, Save Vein chime and Focus heal, and the boss
phase-change roar; plus the per-zone ambient loops, boss themes, and title/victory cues with
combat ducking. A shell Config volume row may drive levels.

### M16 — Acceptance & determinism
Land the acceptance harness against all 15 scenarios (§14): run-accel cap, variable jump
height, coyote time, jump buffering, ability-gate block-then-unlock, dash i-frames, post-hit
invulnerability window, melee combo, pogo + air-dash refresh, save/load round-trip, Shade
death cache, Boss A phase transition, camera room-lock clamp, input edge-vs-held for dash,
and the seed + recorded-input **fixed-timestep determinism** yielding bit-identical
`Player.Pos`/`Entities` at every frame regardless of real frame rate (§7.5, §13).
